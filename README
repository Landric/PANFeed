PANFeed - Personalised Academic News Feeds

PANFeed is a service which creates personalised news feeds by using keyword identification in posts combined with a 
hotness metric to give the user news which is current and relevent to their listed interests. The keywords are generated by 
using TFIDF to identify the commonality of words in the corpus and in each blog post. Hotness is modifier based on how old 
the post is. 

PANFeed has a simple web interface for submitting feeds and also ships with a web spider for spidering domains in search of RSS and Atom feeds to process. There is also a bin script which should be run frequently to pull more news in from existing feeds.
