Development has been completed, and the finished software has been sent to handset manufacturers and mobile operators for configuration and testing. Public release remains scheduled for fall.</p>\n\n<p>Mango is a substantial upgrade, offering a wealth of features both <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/05/microsoft-unveils-windows-phone-mango-at-least-in-part.ars\">for users</a>&#8212;including Twitter and LinkedIn integration, Facebook and Windows Live Messenger chat, a hugely improved Web browser, turn-by-turn navigation, and rich Bing integration&#8212;<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/04/windows-phone-7-mango-one-heck-of-an-upgrade.ars\">and developers</a>&#8212;a far more complete, capable API, limited multitasking, greater integration with built-in phone features&#8212;alike. The improvements all add up to make Mango a much more well-rounded and feature-rich platform than the original release, and do a good job of building on the foundations that the first release laid down: strong visual design, the aggregation of data, and the emphasis on making cloud services like Bing and Facebook an integral part of the platform.</p>\n\n<p>Even as the software has been RTMed, many questions remain. Developers were given access to a <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/06/mango-goodness-windows-phone-developer-firmware-invitations-roll-out.ars\">prerelease</a> late last month, but Microsoft is still <a href=\"http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_phone/b/windowsphone/archive/2011/07/26/windows-phone-mango-released-to-manufacturing.aspx#comments\">working</a> to get a finalized SDK and firmware version out to developers, and hasn\'t yet said when that will occur. Some features, such as the Twitter and LinkedIn integration, weren\'t available in the beta version, so the full extent of the integration and features for these remains unknown.</p>\n\n<p>Even the final name and branding isn\'t known; the developer documentation describes Mango as version 7.1, but the beta firmware calls itself 7.5.</p>\n\n<p>There\'s also been little said about hardware support. Mango will be available for every current Windows Phone device on the market, but a range of new devices&#8212;with new hardware specs&#8212;are expected to arrive with Mango. Microsoft has announced that Mango will include support for some additional processors and gyroscopes, but so far, that\'s the extent of what the company has said. Forward-facing cameras are widely expected, after <a href=\"http://www.wpcentral.com/front-facing-cameras-still-possibility-mango\">analysis of the SDK</a> showed evidence of software support for such a thing&#8212;but Microsoft hasn\'t confirmed anything of the sort. Even without a substantial hardware revision, new Mango hardware will certainly be shipping, however, including the first Nokia handsets, videos of which <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/06/video-of-nokias-first-windows-phone-device-leaks-onto-the-internet.ars\">\"leaked\" onto the Internet</a> last month.</p>    \n        \n    \n\n\n      <p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/07/windows-phone-mango-rtmed-shipped-to-manufacturers-networks.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss&amp;comments=1#comments-bar\">Read the comments on this post</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/1TpsqLXrJvVzVVK6Fh67R0rGODQ/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/1TpsqLXrJvVzVVK6Fh67R0rGODQ/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/1TpsqLXrJvVzVVK6Fh67R0rGODQ/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/1TpsqLXrJvVzVVK6Fh67R0rGODQ/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=HMuq1asFUUk:_eRDM7HuUpk:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=HMuq1asFUUk:_eRDM7HuUpk:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=HMuq1asFUUk:_eRDM7HuUpk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=HMuq1asFUUk:_eRDM7HuUpk:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=HMuq1asFUUk:_eRDM7HuUpk:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=HMuq1asFUUk:_eRDM7HuUpk:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~4/HMuq1asFUUk\" width=\"1\" />','http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~3/HMuq1asFUUk/windows-phone-mango-rtmed-shipped-to-manufacturers-networks.ars','http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index/\n',5227,NULL,'2011-07-27 02:09:00'),(2,'New codec pack brings RAW support to Explorer, Live Photo Gallery','<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/microsoft/news/2011/07/new-codec-pack-brings-raw-support-to-explorer-live-photo-gallery.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss\">\n  <img align=\"right\" border=\"0\" height=\"129\" hspace=\"4\" src=\"http://static.arstechnica.net/brief_icons_new/microsoft-brief.png\" vspace=\"4\" width=\"230\" />\n  </a>\n\n		        <!--body-->\n    <p>Microsoft has <a href=\"http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2011/07/26/photo-gallery-now-supports-raw-format.aspx\">released</a> a codec pack providing native RAW support to both Windows Explorer and Windows Live Photo Gallery. With the pack installed, Explorer will show thumbnails for the RAW files produced by most popular digital cameras, and Windows Live Photo Gallery will offer its full range of editing and metadata manipulation features. The pack is free, and available for both 32 and 64-bit versions of Windows Vista and Windows 7.</p>\n\n<p>RAW image formats are supported by pretty much all digital SLRs and many digital point-and-shoot cameras to provide the best possible image quality. RAW files capture the unprocessed digitized output of the camera\'s sensor, without any post-processing such as white balance correction, and without the lossy compression that\'s found in JPEG images. The close relationship to the actual camera sensors means that the formats are quite varied, and typically each camera vendor has its own proprietary, undocumented format.</p>\n\n<p>As a Canon-shooter, the lack of built-in support for the CR2 files that my camera spits out has long annoyed me. Canon has a <a href=\"http://www.usa.canon.com/cusa/support/consumer/eos_slr_camera_systems/eos_digital_slr_cameras/canon_raw_codec_software\">codec</a> that enables Explorer to show thumbnails from RAW images, but in spite of offering periodic updates for the software, Canon has never bothered to provide 64-bit support, and as a 64-bit Windows 7 user, that leaves me high and dry.

The Pew Internet Project is one of seven projects that comprise the Pew Research Center, a non-profit &#8220;fact tank&#8221; that produces reports on American trends and attitudes.</p>\n \n<p>Pew found that 71 percent of online adults have gone to video-sharing sites like YouTube and Vimeo. That is a 5 percentage point increase from Pew&#8217;s research in 2010, and a 38-point increase from 2006. Twenty-eight percent of Americans use video-sharing sites on a given day. </p>\n \n<p>Kathleen Moore, the Pew Internet Project analyst who wrote the report, explained the increase in usage: &#8220;The rise of broadband and better mobile networks and devices has meant that video has become an increasingly popular part of users&#8217; online experiences&#x2026; video-sharing sites are very social spaces as people vote on, comment on, and share these videos with others.&#8221;</p>\n \n<p>Moore also cites the dramatic increase in content as a major reason for the expanded viewership. Forty-eight hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube every minute, adding up to nearly 8 years of content daily.</p>\n \n<p>And YouTube isn&#8217;t just for the young crowd. Even though YouTube lists its demographic as 18-54 years old, Pew found that nearly one-third of online Americans age 65 and older uses video sharing sites.</p>\n \n<p>Parents are also 20 percentage points more likely to have used a video sharing site than non-parents. In fact, parental use has increased in the past year while non-parental use has dipped. </p>\n \n<p>Pew was surprised to find that rural Internet users are just as likely to have used video-sharing sites as urban and suburban users; an insignificant 4 percentage points separate the three demographics. However, rural users are less likely to use the sites on a given day (14 percent compared to 31 percent for suburban and 33 percent for urban). </p>\n \n<p>The Project also reported that non-whites are more likely to use video-sharing sites than whites. Sixty-nine percent of whites admitted to using the sites (more than double the 31 percent in 2006), compared to 79 percent of non-whites (up from the 41 percent in 2006). </p>\n \n<p>There is a direct correlation between household income and the percent of Internet users who use video-sharing sites; the study found that online Americans with an income of $75,000 are most likely to use the sites, at 81 percent.</p>\n \n<p>Moore commented on the ability to upload and stream video via mobile devices as a recent phenomenon impacting the usage of video-sharing sites. Pew did not ask about mobile devices&nbsp;in its study&nbsp;until this year, but found that 34 percent of American cell phone owners have shot video on their phone; 26 percent have watched video on their phone, and 22 percent have used their phone to post videos or photos online.</p>    \n        \n    \n\n\n      <p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2011/07/no-wonder-we-watch-48-hours-of-footage-upped-to-youtube-daily.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss&amp;comments=1#comments-bar\">Read the comments on this post</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eMZIAEfJ4afYxiC-yBuJprrYh_Y/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eMZIAEfJ4afYxiC-yBuJprrYh_Y/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eMZIAEfJ4afYxiC-yBuJprrYh_Y/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/eMZIAEfJ4afYxiC-yBuJprrYh_Y/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=P1K0nGrF6vc:tQwNH6RC_CY:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=P1K0nGrF6vc:tQwNH6RC_CY:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=P1K0nGrF6vc:tQwNH6RC_CY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=P1K0nGrF6vc:tQwNH6RC_CY:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=P1K0nGrF6vc:tQwNH6RC_CY:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=P1K0nGrF6vc:tQwNH6RC_CY:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~4/P1K0nGrF6vc\" width=\"1\" />','http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~3/P1K0nGrF6vc/no-wonder-we-watch-48-hours-of-footage-upped-to-youtube-daily.ars','http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index/\n',5175,NULL,'2011-07-26 18:50:32'),(7,'Through the mists of time: how we discovered the age of the Earth','<p>  <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/07/through-the-mists-of-time-how-we-discovered-the-age-of-the-earth.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss\">\n	  <img align=\"\" border=\"0\" height=\"381\" hspace=\"4\" src=\"http://static.arstechnica.net/assets/2011/07/chromite_geology-4e2ed78-intro-thumb-640xauto-24056.jpg\" vspace=\"4\" width=\"640\" />\n	  </a>\n  </p>\n		        <!--body-->\n    <p>\n\"Where did we come from?\" It\'s a central human question that drives us to wonder about origins&#8212;of humans, life, the Earth, the Universe. The age of the Earth is central to that question, and it has been taken on by human cultures for millennia. But only in the last couple centuries have we obtained the means to unequivocally determine that age from actual evidence. The road was a long one.\n</p>\n<p>\nIn the late 1700s, geology was in its infancy. Rock layers (of any type) were only starting to be recognized as something other than deposits from a catastrophic, world-wide flood. James Hutton, a Scottish scientist, became enthralled with the fantastic histories he saw recorded in the rocks of his homeland. At a now-famous seaside outcrop on the eastern coast of Scotland, he saw nearly horizontal layers of red sandstone on top of completely vertical layers of a much different, gray sedimentary rock. He was the first to grasp the significance of that spatial relationship.\n</p>    \n          <p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/07/through-the-mists-of-time-how-we-discovered-the-age-of-the-earth.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss\" title=\"Click here to continue reading this article\"><img alt=\"Read the rest of this article...\" src=\"http://static.arstechnica.net/mt-static/plugins/ArsTheme/images/read-more.jpg\" /></a></p>      \n        \n    \n\n\n      <p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/science/news/2011/07/through-the-mists-of-time-how-we-discovered-the-age-of-the-earth.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss&amp;comments=1#comments-bar\">Read the comments on this post</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/OtBcZv_H8OvAkLPk25qXLPDPh3U/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/OtBcZv_H8OvAkLPk25qXLPDPh3U/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/OtBcZv_H8OvAkLPk25qXLPDPh3U/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/OtBcZv_H8OvAkLPk25qXLPDPh3U/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qXskEWYPbv0:hswUlB1XJdE:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qXskEWYPbv0:hswUlB1XJdE:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qXskEWYPbv0:hswUlB1XJdE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=qXskEWYPbv0:hswUlB1XJdE:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qXskEWYPbv0:hswUlB1XJdE:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=qXskEWYPbv0:hswUlB1XJdE:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~4/qXskEWYPbv0\" width=\"1\" />','http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~3/qXskEWYPbv0/through-the-mists-of-time-how-we-discovered-the-age-of-the-earth.ars','http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index/\n',3473,NULL,'2011-07-26 17:02:00'),(8,'Lack of similar services means most Netflix customers sticking around','<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/web/news/2011/07/netflix-ceo-fewer-complaints-than-expected-over-price-hike.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss\">\n  <img align=\"right\" border=\"0\" height=\"129\" hspace=\"4\" src=\"http://static.arstechnica.net/assets/2011/07/netflix_rental-4e2ee28-listing-thumb-230x130-24059-f.jpg\" vspace=\"4\" width=\"230\" />\n  </a>\n\n		        <!--body-->\n    <p>It has been two weeks since Netflix announced, much to the chagrin of its loyal user base, that it would be hiking its monthly subscription prices by 60 percent for users who want both streaming and discs.

What Veselago saw was that a positive refractive index is the product of the details of a material\'s response to the electric and magnetic components of the light field. But if one could play with material structures on the scale of the wavelength of light, it might be possible to create materials that had a negative refractive index&#8212;or no refractive index at all.\n</p>\n<p>\nLate last century, fabrication techniques finally caught up, and Veselago\'s work started getting the attention that it deserved.

In particular, they were looking for how reward-based applications like SMS, e-mail, and the parts of Web-browsing that produce updates affect behavior.\n</p>    \n          <p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/07/the-quicker-we-can-get-info-from-smartphones-the-more-addicted-we-aresetting-avalanche-of-information-creating-smartphone-addicts.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss\" title=\"Click here to continue reading this article\"><img alt=\"Read the rest of this article...\" src=\"http://static.arstechnica.net/mt-static/plugins/ArsTheme/images/read-more.jpg\" /></a></p>      \n        \n    \n\n\n      <p><a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/news/2011/07/the-quicker-we-can-get-info-from-smartphones-the-more-addicted-we-aresetting-avalanche-of-information-creating-smartphone-addicts.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss&amp;comments=1#comments-bar\">Read the comments on this post</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/cmtrHrL2Ba9YCyggkjBVTKTSjck/0/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/cmtrHrL2Ba9YCyggkjBVTKTSjck/0/di\" /></a><br />\n<a href=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/cmtrHrL2Ba9YCyggkjBVTKTSjck/1/da\"><img border=\"0\" ismap=\"true\" src=\"http://feedads.g.doubleclick.net/~at/cmtrHrL2Ba9YCyggkjBVTKTSjck/1/di\" /></a></p><div class=\"feedflare\">\n<a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=HikVTdovDUI:zp3dvtpGMOI:V_sGLiPBpWU\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=HikVTdovDUI:zp3dvtpGMOI:V_sGLiPBpWU\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=HikVTdovDUI:zp3dvtpGMOI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?i=HikVTdovDUI:zp3dvtpGMOI:F7zBnMyn0Lo\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=HikVTdovDUI:zp3dvtpGMOI:qj6IDK7rITs\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=qj6IDK7rITs\" /></a> <a href=\"http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?a=HikVTdovDUI:zp3dvtpGMOI:yIl2AUoC8zA\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~ff/arstechnica/index?d=yIl2AUoC8zA\" /></a>\n</div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~4/HikVTdovDUI\" width=\"1\" />','http://feeds.arstechnica.com/~r/arstechnica/index/~3/HikVTdovDUI/the-quicker-we-can-get-info-from-smartphones-the-more-addicted-we-aresetting-avalanche-of-information-creating-smartphone-addicts.ars','http://feeds.arstechnica.com/arstechnica/index/\n',3702,NULL,'2011-07-25 21:00:00'),(18,'Law firm enlists AT&T customers to fight merger with T-Mobile','<a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/07/law-firm-enlists-att-customers-to-fight-merger-with-t-mobile.ars?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=rss\">\n  <img align=\"right\" border=\"0\" height=\"129\" hspace=\"4\" src=\"http://static.arstechnica.net/brief_icons_new/tech-policy-brief.png\" vspace=\"4\" width=\"230\" />\n  </a>\n\n		        <!--body-->\n    <p>Bursor &amp; Fisher, P.A., a New York-based law firm with a history of taking on telecoms, has launched <a href=\"http://www.fightthemerger.com/\">Fight The Merger</a>, an initiative opposing the proposed $39 billion merger between AT&amp;T and T-Mobile. Merger opponents argue that a successful block of the merger will prevent a duopoly between AT&amp;T and Verizon, and preserve competition in the wireless market.</p>\n\n\n<p>Bursor &amp; Fisher&#8212;which has represented customers in cases against both AT&amp;T and T-Mobile in the past&#8212;has signed up a few dozen AT&amp;T customers to oppose the unpopular merger. The Fight The Merger site notes that a successful takeover would leave AT&amp;T and Verizon controlling 80 percent of the market, which it argues would result in hindered innovation and little consumer protection from high prices. Sprint, which has struggled lately, would be the only nationwide competition to AT&amp;T and Verizon, and it has <a href=\"http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2011/03/sprint-no-attt-mobile-no-way.ars\"> vocally opposed</a> the merger.</p><p>Bursor &amp; Fisher will attempt to thwart the merger through arbitration via the Clayton Antitrust Act. The law firm interprets the Act as allowing those who would be affected by a merger with monopolistic implication to prevent the merger from being completed. Bursor &amp; Fisher is confident in its ability to use AT&amp;T&#8217;s own Arbitration Agreement to stop the merger, despite a customer agreement that keeps individual customers from suing AT&amp;T. If AT&amp;T does not cease and desist within 30 days, Bursor &amp; Fisher will file a demand for arbitration with the American Arbitration Association.</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T has dismissed Fight The Merger. &#8220;The claims made by the Bursor &amp; Fisher Law Firm are completely without merit,\" an AT&amp;T spokesperson told Ars. \"An arbitrator has no authority to block the merger or affect the merger process in any way.&nbsp; Our arbitration provision allows customers to resolve their individual disputes with AT&amp;T in a prompt and consumer-friendly manner.&#8221;</p>\n<p>AT&amp;T also made its <a href=\"http://mobilizeeverything.com/\"> merger plans</a> available to the public. As the company indicated in its <a href=\"http://www.att.com/Investor/Financial/Earning_Info/docs/2Q_11_slide_c.pdf\">second-quarter earnings call</a> last week, the telecom believes the merger remains on track for regulatory approval.</p>\n<p>Bursor &amp; Fisher is no stranger to the wireless industry, having represented customers of Verizon, AT&amp;T, Cingular, Sprint and T-Mobile in past legal actions.

There is a small catch though: you need to  bring your original OS installation discs that came with your iMac so that your replacement hard drive will have an operating system on it when you get back.

But as soon as you become a student it becomes positively rapturous. </p><p><p>There are a lot of things to be excited about, and choosing a decent computer to last the duration of your course is one of them. We\'ve scoured our peerless laptop reviews to search out 10 of the laptops that are best for students. </p><p>We mainly picked cheap laptops - after all, scholars aren\'t renowned for being flush for cash - but we\'ve added a few for more specific courses.</p><p><strong>1. Toshiba NB550D - £262</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Toshiba nb550d\" src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Laptop/WLT%20148/WLT148.solo.toshiba2_1-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Netbooks are great for students: they\'re light, compact and cheap. Unfortunately, they\'re usually woefully underpowered. Toshiba\'s netbook bucks the trend by including AMD Fusion graphics, which mean it\'s capable of playing HD videos and photo editing. It\'s well designed, too, with nice speakers, a bright screen, and a tough, rubberised finish. The responsive keyboard and a large touchpad make it a pleasure to use. Unlike you, it won\'t fall asleep in lengthy lectures - the battery lasts for an incredible 10 hours.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/toshiba-nb550d-939235/review\">Read our Toshiba NB550D review</a></p><p><strong>2.

Its Pentium P6000 processor may be maturing, but it can still make mincemeat of multitasking, as well as full HD video playback and advanced photo editing. The HDMI port means it can be connected to a TV, and it\'s fairly lightweight with a decent 250 minutes of battery life. Add to this the brushed-metal finish and you\'ve got a laptop that looks and performs like one twice its price.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/acer-aspire-5741z-970057/review\">Read our Acer Aspire 5741Z review</a></p><p><strong>3.

Specifications are basic but perfectly adept, battery life weighs in at a good seven hours, and it\'s all wrapped up in a nice-looking chassis. For better or worse Samsung has pre-installed a lot of software on the NC110, but we actually found some of it rather handy, such as a WiFi finding tool. It\'s ideal for students who want something that looks the part.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-nc110-966868/review\">Read our Samsung NC110 review</a></p><p><strong>4.

Its colourful design and bright screen certainly make it stand out, and it\'s light and thin enough to stick in your rucksack next to your four pack of Carling, flute, and tatty copy of The Bell Jar. Performance wise it\'s up to the standard word processing and web browsing, but it also packs 524 minutes of battery life.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/packard-bell-dot-se-950918/review\">Read our Packard Bell Dot SE review</a></p><p><strong>5.

Internally it\'s nicely fleshed out, too, with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and a 320GB hard drive. It\'s got an impressive screen, but where the X32A really impresses is in its hidden extras.

USB 3.0 is provided for quick file transfers, and Asus\'s own ExpressGate lets you jump on the internet quickly and easily. There\'s even a fingerprint scanner to stop people cribbing your essays. Its battery lasts for an impressive six hours, and the screen is vibrant and bright. At £350 it\'s the most expensive netbook in this round-up, but it\'s worth paying for the added extras.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/asus-eee-pc-1018p-939410/review\">Read our Asus Eee PC 1018P review</a></p><p><strong>7.

It\'s fully-featured for such a modestly-priced laptop, too, cramming 6GB RAM, a Core i3 350M processor and an ATi Mobility Radeon HD5470 graphics chip into its case. We were slightly deflated by the build quality and battery life, but it\'s ideal as a desktop replacement that occasionally wanders into lectures.

This means it\'s capable of video and photo editing, making it perfect for media or photography students. We weren\'t happy with the keyboard (especially the \"strange, blocky font\"), but the trackpad and build quality more than made up for it. The battery lasted an impressive 333 minutes, and despite its bulkiness it\'s still fairly portable.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/msi-cx640-018uk-958303/review\">Read our MSI CX640-018UK review</a></p><p><strong>9.

The 11.6-inch LED screen is bright and clear, and won\'t strain your eyes when you\'re working in programs with a lot of white space, like word processors. The Aspire One 721 also weighs just 1.40kg and at only 1.1-inches thick, it\'s easy to carry along with books and other studying materials. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/acer-aspire-one-721-980246/review\">Read our Acer Aspire One 721 review</a></p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16ed2f59/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Buying+Guide%3A+10+best+laptops+for+students&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fmobile-computing%2Flaptops%2F10-best-laptops-for-students-983385%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Buying+Guide%3A+10+best+laptops+for+students&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fmobile-computing%2Flaptops%2F10-best-laptops-for-students-983385%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877756871/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16ed2f59/kg/216-221-239-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877756871/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16ed2f59/kg/216-221-239-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~4/dzMKUz4kpY8\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~3/dzMKUz4kpY8/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing\n',10999,NULL,'2011-07-26 10:16:00'),(50,'PC still men\'s favourite gadget','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/images/sony-vaio-fz-series-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Steve Jobs may be talking about a post PC era, but the results of a major survey by AskMen suggests that, at least for those with a Y chromosome, the humble computer is still our favourite tech. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.askmen.com/specials/great_male_survey\">The Great Male Survey</a> has 70,000 participants, with 7,500 of those in the UK, and gives an insight into what a slice of the male population holds dear. </p><p>When asked what device they could not live without 67 per cent answered \'computer\' and perhaps more illuminating was the fact that 64 per cent said they were using a computer outside of work ahead of tablets, phones and even the television. </p><p><strong>Fish and chip paper shortage?</strong></p><p>The survey also looked at reading habit, and 41 per cent of those surveyed said that, although they still read a paper in print format, they did not pack themselves off to the newsagents as much as they used to. </p><p>\"Men in 2011 are kings of convergence, many said they couldn\'t live without their computer – and this is backed up by other statistics, with a fifth of males saying they no longer watch TV or a conventional way, and are visiting the cinema less to download films online – either legally, or illegally, said AskMen editor Drew Lubega.</p><p>\"Technology is making it even easier for men to consume media on their terms, often through a single screen.\"</p><p>Oddly, 43 per cent of respondents said that they watched their favourite television series on their computers rather than on a television -

generation: 10 things we want to see','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/New%20iPod%20touch%202010/touch1-200-200.jpg\" /><p>When Apple releases the iPod touch 5th generation or iPod touch 5G later this year – as tradition suggests it will – how does the company go about improving an already stellar media player-cum portable internet and gaming device? </p><p><p>We gave the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/gadgets/ipods-and-portable-audio/ipod-and-mp3-players/apple-ipod-touch-4g-716177/review\">iPod touch 4th generation</a> 4.5 stars last year, since it brought many of the iPhone 4\'s features to the market at a lower cost. </p><p>In recent years, the annual September iPod announcements have been preceded by a new iPhone, which has tended to give a clue as to what the new iPod touch will bring – the Retina Display and A4 processor last year, for example.</p><p>With the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-5-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-721534\">iPhone 5</a> (or will it be an <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-5-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-721534\">iPhone 4S</a>?) not expected to arrive until September, it looks like we may see both the iPhone and iPod touch updated at the same time, to coincide with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/ios-5-all-the-latest-details-940484\">iOS 5 release date</a>. </p><p>Now 2010 saw the whole iPod range updated, except for the iPod classic, which is now nearly two years old. </p><p>Its key selling point remains its 160GB capacity, but in other areas it\'s stood still while its siblings have surged forward – it still has a traditional hard drive where the iPod touch has flash memory, for example, and lacks a touch screen, which even the £131 <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/gadgets/ipods-and-portable-audio/ipod-and-mp3-players/apple-ipod-nano-6g-716178/review\">iPod nano</a> boasts. </p><p>It seems unlikely the iPod classic will make it into the line-up of 2011 iPods, especially if Apple ups the capacity of the new iPod touch. Which brings us nicely onto our wishlist for the iPod touch 5th gen…</p><p><strong>1. Capacity, capacity, capacity</strong></p><p>The iPod touch already comes in 8GB, 32GB and 64GB models, but in capacity terms, it\'s still a way behind the iPod classic, which gives you a whopping 160GB. We expect the entry-level iPod touch 5 to get a capacity bump to at least 16GB. At the top end, we hope Apple gives us at least a 128GB model. An even higher option would be nice, too…</p><p><strong>2. Cheaper models</strong></p><p>Although the entry-level iPod touch isn\'t prohibitively expensive at under £200, the 32GB and 64GB models cost £254 and £336 respectively – hardly what you\'d call cheap. Sure, a lot of that cost\'s down to the high price of the solid-state flash storage the iPod touch uses, but with memory costs coming down all the time, we really hope to see the prices slashed, especially at the top end.</p><p><strong>3. A5 processor</strong></p><p>The 2011 iPod touch will, in all likelihood, have an A5 processor, just like the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/apple-ipad-2-935199/review\">iPad 2</a>. Although the 4th gen iPod touch is hardly sluggish, a new, faster chip will make it fly along, and be a big boost to gamers.</p><p><strong>4. Better stills camera</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/apple-iphone-4-694980/review\">iPhone 4</a>\'s 5-megapixel camera, while not amazing, takes reasonable stills (see below). Not so the current <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/gadgets/ipods-and-portable-audio/ipod-and-mp3-players/apple-ipod-touch-4g-716177/review\">iPod touch with its paltry 0.69 megapixels</a>. While this is probably a lot to do with the cost and physical size of the camera itself, we\'d like to see at least some improvement to the camera in the new iPod touch. Oh, and a variable-focus lens would be nice, too.</p><p><strong>iPhone 4 photo...</strong></p><p><img alt=\"iphone 4\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/New%20iPod%20touch%202010/iPhone_image-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><a href=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/New%20iPod%20touch%202010/iPhone_image.jpg\">See full-res image</a></p><p><strong>iPod touch 4G photo...</strong></p><p><img alt=\"ipod touch\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/New%20iPod%20touch%202010/iPod_touch_image-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><a href=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/New%20iPod%20touch%202010/iPod_touch_image.jpg\">See full-res image</a></p><p><strong>5. Fingerprint-resistant screen coating</strong></p><p>Ever noticed how smeary the iPod touch screen gets? That\'s because it doesn\'t have the fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating on it that the iPhone 3GS and 4 do. It may seem like a minor complaint, but we get pretty sick of constantly having to clean the screen on our 4th gen iPod touch.</p><p><strong>6. A scratch-proof back</strong></p><p>Unless you keep your iPod touch wrapped in cotton wool, the shiny metal back invariably gets scratched up very quickly. So for the iPod touch 2011, let\'s have the back made of something a little more suited to the purpose it\'s designed for – a tougher, more scratch-resistant metal. </p><p><img alt=\"Scratched touch\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/world%20of%20tech/scratchediPodtouch-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p><strong>7. 3G for data only</strong></p><p>If you want a pocket-sized device with internet access wherever you are, your options at the moment are to buy an iPhone, or carry round a MiFi to get your iPod touch online. But <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/portable-devices/mp3-players/rumour-apple-planning-3g-ipod-touch-976758\">rumour has it</a> that the touch screen iPod will offer a 3G option for data, much like the iPad. This would make it arguably the perfect portable internet device. Do we like this idea? You bet we do – no more shelling out for all those minutes in an iPhone contract that go to waste every month.</p><p>But if we do see a 3G option, don\'t expect it to come cheap, seeing as it\'s likely to cost Apple a fair few iPhone sales, <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/ios-5-all-the-latest-details-940484\">especially in combination with iOS 5 and iMessage</a>.</p><p><strong>8. Better audio and video format support</strong></p><p>OK, this one\'s extremely unlikely, but that doesn\'t make it any less desirable. For a start, let\'s have support for OGG, FLAC audio, plus XVID and AVI video. Yes, you can convert them, or play these various formats in dedicated apps, such as AVPlayer (read Tap!\'s <a href=\"http://www.tapmag.co.uk/review/407976815/avplayerhd\">review of the HD version here</a>), but why make us jump through hoops? Anyway, back in the real world…</p><p><strong>9. Include a remote again</strong></p><p>Apple quietly stopped including earphones with a remote with the 4th gen iPod touch. Sneaky. OK, so if you want good-quality audio, you\'re not going to use the Apple earphones, but this is Apple\'s premium iPod – they shouldn\'t be skimping on the headphones! Bring back the in-wire clicker remote, we say.</p><p><strong>10. White model</strong></p><p>The iPhone comes in black and white editions. So does the iPad 2. So it\'s probably a reasonable assumption that there will be a white iPod touch 5th generation as well. <a href=\"http://www.appleinsider.com/articles/11/07/22/apple_roadmap_hints_at_white_ipod_touch_but_few_changes_in_2011\">We\'re not the only ones</a>, it seems.</p><p>----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16e68b75/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16b7e205/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Caudio0Cportable0Eaudio0Cbest0Eiphone0Espeaker0Edock0E50Ereviewed0E97940A50Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best iPhone speaker dock: 5 reviewed</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=In+Depth%3A+iPod+touch+5th+generation%3A+10+things+we+want+to+see&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Faudio%2Fportable-audio%2Fipod-touch-5th-generation-10-things-we-want-to-see-982877%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=In+Depth%3A+iPod+touch+5th+generation%3A+10+things+we+want+to+see&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Faudio%2Fportable-audio%2Fipod-touch-5th-generation-10-things-we-want-to-see-982877%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877787735/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16e68b75/kg/201-216-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877787735/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16e68b75/kg/201-216-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~4/OyWu_zk8ke4\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~3/OyWu_zk8ke4/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing\n',9619,NULL,'2011-07-25 10:22:00'),(55,'Adobe shuts two app stores','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/images/adobe_air-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Adobe has taken the decision to close the doors of its InMarket and Adobe Air Marketplace, with the Flash-maker deciding to focus its efforts on supporting its wares on other people\'s app stores. </p><p>In a brief note, Adobe announced that both InMarket and Air marketplace would cease to exist on 31 August, suggesting that the services had served their purpose and that other, larger marketplaces were now better placed to serve its customers.</p><p>\"After reviewing our efforts and based on feedback from developers, we have decided that we will deliver the most value by helping developers author and publish their apps on multiple platforms, said Adobe <a href=\"http://www.adobe.com/devnet/inmarket.html\">in a blog post</a>.</p><p>\"Given this focus, we have decided to discontinue development and support of Adobe InMarket. We are going to continue to provide support for publishing to different app stores through our tooling.\"</p><p><strong>AIR today… </strong></p><p>\"Concurrent with this change to InMarket, we are also closing Adobe AIR Marketplace,\" added Adobe\'s statement. </p><p>\"When we established Adobe AIR Marketplace three years ago, there were few distribution opportunities for AIR developers.

Tables of Contents (TOCs) </strong></p><p><p>Tables of Contents are useful for longer documents, and so easy to do. </p><p>First, make sure you use defined paragraph styles for your headings. Now place the insertion point where you want it to be added, then use the Insert > Table of Contents command. This displays the TOC tab in the Document Inspector, and you check the box next to each heading style you want the TOC to include. </p><p><img alt=\"tip 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips01-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you check the \'Make page numbers links\' box below, you can click on a page number in the TOC to go straight to that heading. This works both in Page and exported PDF version files. </p><p><strong>2. Alignment guides and preferences </strong></p><p><img alt=\"tip 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips02-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The automatic Alignment Guides are really useful for lining up any objects you add to your documents and \'snapping\' them into position. However, they can sometimes be distracting and get in the way, especially when you\'re trying to position an object very precisely. </p><p>But they are easy to get rid of, all you have to do is hold down Command as you drag them and this will temporarily disable them, leaving you to get on with your work. </p><p><strong>3. Paste while preserving formatting </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips03-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Sometimes you\'ll want to paste in text or numbers from a web page, an email or another document, but the original text formatting (font, size, colour and so on) will be used, which means you may then have to re-style the text. </p><p>The solution is not to use the usual Command+V \'Paste\' shortcut, but use Shift+Option+Command+V instead. This matches the new text to the existing style at the insertion point.</p><p> <strong>4. Option-click tab to bring up multiple inspectors </strong></p><p><img alt=\"tip 4\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips04-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>While the Pages Inspector doesn\'t actually take up that much space on your screen, it does a huge amount of work, and so it can get really tiresome having to continually swap from one tab to another. </p><p>But if you Option-click on a tab icon instead, you\'ll see that it opens up a brand new Inspector window. You\'ll soon find that having a couple of your most-used Inspectors open at the same time will save a lot of clicking. </p><p><strong>5. Outline mode </strong></p><p><img alt=\"tip 5\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips05-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Outlines are really useful for planning and organising documents, and here\'s not one but three outlining mini-tips. </p><p>First, you can save a lot of manual formatting by choosing a suitable Outline Template. Second, there\'s a button on the toolbar for reducing images to unobtrusive thumbnails. Third, there\'s another button that curtails long paragraphs into a single line. </p><p><strong>6. Password protection <br /></strong></p><p><img alt=\"tip 6\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips06-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>There are lots of reasons why you might want to password-protect your documents, such as you are using a shared computer or you are working with sensitive information.</p><p> If you take a look at the bottom of the Document Inspector you\'ll see a \'Require password to open\' checkbox. You can choose your own password, or let Pages suggest one for you – and you can type in a hint in case you forget your own password. Duh! </p><p><strong>7. Word counts</strong></p><p><img alt=\"tip 7\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips07-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you\'re asked to write an essay, a report or a magazine article, you\'re probably going to be given a word count. So how do you know how many you\'ve written? </p><p>Take a look at the bottom of the window – the status bar shows you how many words there are in the document and, if you select some text, how many there are in the selection too.</p><p><strong>8. Sections and Word Processing</strong></p><p><img alt=\"tip 8\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips08-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Sections are a great way to split up and logically organise long Word Processing documents and make them manageable. </p><p>Each section can be moved around in the document by dragging its page thumbnail (outlined in yellow in the page thumbnail panel here). You can use different page numbering, headers and footers and column layouts for each section. </p><p><strong>9. Tables can be spreadsheets </strong></p><p><img alt=\"tip 9\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips09-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The tables you add needn\'t just be boxes with words in. They can be used as mini-spreadsheets too, thanks to the functions in the Table Inspector. Format cells to contain dates or currency values, for example, and add a footer row to total up a column of figures. </p><p><strong>10. Two Up page display </strong></p><p><img alt=\"tip 10\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20235/MAC235.main_feat.s03_tips10-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>When you\'re working on Page Layout documents, it can be useful to view facing pages side by side. But don\'t use the Two Up option on the pop-up page view menu at the bottom left of the screen. </p><p>This is the wrong way to go about it because it will put the first (front) page of the document on the left and the first inside page on the right, and all the pages will be out of sync.</p><p> Instead, click the \'Facing Pages\' box in the Document Inspector. This will put the first page on the right and will display page thumbnails as \'spreads\'.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16e0c48d/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=In+Depth%3A+10+top+Pages+tips+and+tricks&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fsoftware%2Fapplications%2F10-top-pages-tips-and-tricks-980721%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=In+Depth%3A+10+top+Pages+tips+and+tricks&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fsoftware%2Fapplications%2F10-top-pages-tips-and-tricks-980721%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877567994/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16e0c48d/kg/253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877567994/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16e0c48d/kg/253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~4/goAWGUq5rOc\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~3/goAWGUq5rOc/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing\n',7967,NULL,'2011-07-24 07:00:00'),(57,'Review Roundup: This week\'s hottest reviews on TechRadar','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/TechRadar/Mobile%20phones/HP/HP%20Veer/handson%20photosofveer/HP_Veer_05-200-200.jpg\" /><p>This week we\'ve taken a first look at the new webOS HP Veer smartphone as well as Apple\'s brand-new MacBook Air featuring blistering performance from Intel\'s Core i5 and i7 processors.</p><p><p>We\'ve also reviewed Nokia\'s latest X7 smartphone as well as the Samsung Galaxy S and Samsung Galaxy Pro. Check all our reviews out below. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/hp-veer-933871/review\">HP Veer review</a></p><p>In the beginning, there was Palm. The company created the handheld/smartphone category with the original personal digital assistants in 1996. Now, following an HP acquisition about a year ago, it\'s emerged with a new super-tiny model, the HP Veer.</p><p>The smartphone is priced at $99 with a two-year contract in the US, with costs yet to be announced in the UK. It\'s so light, at 103g, and small, at 84x54x15.1mm, that it almost seems like a toy phone – something you would pass on to little Johnny Radar Jr in the back seat to keep him silent. The Veer is generally well-packaged, but unless it comes with a fantastic price point when it lands on UK shores, it\'s not going to be a winner for HP.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-apple-macbook-air-2011-review-981684\">New MacBook Air review</a></p><p>The MacBook Air that debuted last October was a mighty fine-looking piece of hardware - a newly designed unibody shell, 0.3cm at its thinnest. Trouble is, the meat inside didn\'t quite match up with the supreme exterior – Apple had been forced to stick with the ageing Intel Core 2 Duo processor. </p><p>The great news is that the new models don\'t lack for performance. Even the base models are stacked. The off-the-shelf models come with the blistering Core i5 1.6 (11-inch, £849/£999 depending on memory and SSD) or 1.7GHz (13-inch, £1,099/£1,349 depending on memory and SSD) variants. Even better is that, for an extra £100, you can upgrade to a 1.8GHz Core i7.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/nokia-x7-943467/review\">Nokia X7 review</a></p><p>The Nokia X7 ought to be a flagship smartphone – it has a vast screen, it runs a revamped touchscreen OS and it looks rather nice too. It has an 8MP camera, super video playback and, at first glance, plenty of storage capacity. But we just aren\'t sure where Symbian Anna is headed in the long term, and that alone could make the Nokia X7 a blind alley. </p><p>And it doesn\'t do anything supremely well. If you are a Nokia fan and want a top quality camera you should be looking at the Nokia N8. If you want a superb physical keyboard, then the Nokia E7 is worth your attention. Great social networking integration? Go Android instead, with something such as the HTC Sensation. With those bases covered, it\'s tricky to see precisely where the Nokia X7 fits in.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s-689293/review\">Samsung Galaxy S</a></p><p>One of the jewels in the previous-generation Android crown, the Samsung Galaxy S has recently been updated to Android 2.3.3, giving it Gingerbread features as well as improved performance and better battery life. We take another look to see what impact the updates have had.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-pro-961384/review\">Samsung Galaxy Pro</a></p><p>The Samsung Galaxy Pro had us spitting feathers at times, while at other times we really enjoyed using it. It was a real love/hate affair, caused by the two key features of the smartphone.</p><p><img alt=\"Samsung galaxy pro\"

do after installing OS X Lion','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/lionafterinstall/launchpad-200-200.jpg\" /><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-mac-os-x-lion-review-981259\">Mac OS 10.7 Lion</a> is finally here and like most Mac users you\'ll be installing it at some point over the next few days, if you haven\'t done so already. </p><p>Since it\'s only £21 it\'s a bargain, so there\'s really no reason not to (unless you have an old Mac with a pre-Core 2 Duo processor, of course). It goes without saying that you should backup your Mac before downloading and installing Lion, but once you\'ve installed Lion what should you do next? </p><p>Before we start, a word of advice for anyone who has just downloaded the Lion installer, but not actually started the installation. Stop! Copy the Install OS X file that you\'ll find in your Applications folder to an external drive, so you don\'t have to download it again on all your other Macs, too. </p><p>At 4GB it\'s a hefty download, so you can save yourself some serious time with this tip. Remember, you can\'t do this after you\'ve finished installing Lion, because the installer file is removed, so do it now and thank us later.</p><p>We found the installation itself to be quick and painless, and once Lion is up and running you\'re ready to take it for a spin. Just be aware that Spotlight will be indexing your Mac for the first half an hour or so, and this can slow things like animations down a little bit. </p><p>So, if Lion feels a bit sluggish don\'t write it off quite yet - things will definitely improve once the indexing has finished. <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/os-x-10-7-lion-guide-get-started-with-lion-today-979099\">We\'ve previewed all the new features of Lion before</a>, so we won\'t list them all here. Instead let\'s go through the top 10 things you need to do first in OS X 10.7 Lion. </p><p><strong>1. Reverse \'natural\' scrolling</strong></p><p>Coming from Snow Leopard, the first thing you\'ll find really confusing about Lion is the scrolling direction. In an effort to unify OS X, its desktop operating system, and iOS, its handheld operating system, Apple has changed the default behaviour of the scroll wheel (or ball) on your mouse. Instead of scrolling the page up when you scroll your mouse wheel down (a system that we\'ve been using since scroll wheels were invented), it now scrolls the page down, in an effort to mimic what happens when you swipe down on an iPad with your finger. </p><p><img alt=\"Natural scrolling\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/lionafterinstall/naturalscroll-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>SCROLL AWAY: </strong><em>Turn off natural scrolling to get back to the way things were</em></p><p> Apple calls this \'natural scrolling\'. While this might be fine for the \'post PC\' generation, for the rest of us it feels distinctly unnatural. The good news is you can change things back to the way they were by changing one simple setting. In System Preferences go to General and untick \'Move content in the direction of finger movement when scrolling or navigating\'.</p><p><strong>2. Fix Mail\'s appearance</strong></p><p>Next, let\'s look at Lion Mail. It\'s a definite upgrade to Snow Leopard\'s version of the program - you now get snippets in the message list, conversation view and a new column view. The downside is that with its new column view it feels more like Microsoft\'s Entourage than Apple Mail. If you miss the look and feel of the old Mail then don\'t worry, you can get some of it back. In Mail go to the Mail menu then choose Preferences and click on Viewing. Click on Use Classic Layout and boom! You\'re back in something that looks more like old fashioned Mail. Toggle the Show/Hide button on the Favorites Bar to add the finishing touches.</p><p><strong>3. Update your applications </strong></p><p>Lion is here, but your apps are probably still living in the past. If you want Pages, Keynote and Numbers to make use of the new Versions feature in Lion (more on that later) then you\'ll need to update them. </p><p><img alt=\"Software update\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/lionafterinstall/softwareupdate-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>UPDATE NOW: </strong><em>After you\'ve installed Lion update your apps to get the most out of them</em></p><p>There\'s a new version of iTunes that\'s optimised for Lion, too. To get all this good stuff on your Mac head over to Software Update in System Preferences and click Check Now, then download the updates.</p><p><strong>4. Sort out your apps in LaunchPad</strong></p><p>One of the first things you notice about Lion is the striking new icon for LaunchPad in the Dock. It produces a screen full of your application icons, mimicking SpringBoard, the Home Screen of iOS. It\'s multi-screen too, just click and swipe left to move to the next screen of apps. It\'s a useful feature, but far from perfect - for a start it displays an icon for everything in your applications folder, including all the stuff you don\'t want. </p><p>Your first thought will probably be, \'how do I delete icons from here?\'. The answer is you can only delete apps that were purchased through the Mac App Store. To remove them click and hold on any icon and they\'ll all start to wiggle, the apps you can delete will now have a small x in their top left corner. The only way to remove the other icons is to delete them from your Applications folder in Finder.</p><p><img alt=\"Launchpad\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/lionafterinstall/launchpad-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>START IT UP: </strong><em>Launchpad is useful, but lacks customisation features</em></p><p> One alternative to deleting apps is to create a folder in LaunchPad of all the apps you don\'t want displayed. Just drag one unwanted app and drag it on top of another unwanted app. A new folder will be created. You can rename the folder to anything you like by double-clicking it\'s name when the folder is open.</p><p><strong>5. Expand windows from all corners</strong></p><p>This is a great Lion feature that\'s worth checking out immediately. As OS X users we\'ve always been used to only being able to expand the size of a window by dragging on the bottom right corner. Lion changes all this - you can drag any corner of an open window to resize it, or drag the edges of the window to expand it in that direction.</p><p><strong>6. Check out new desktop backgrounds</strong></p><p>Nothing says your running Lion better than a great big picture of a Lion stamping its authority all over your desktop. </p><p>Think about it - unless you change you desktop background into something Lion-related how are you going to gain bragging rights over all your Snow Leopard-running pals? </p><p><img alt=\"Lion desktop\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/lionafterinstall/liondesktop-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>ROAR: </strong><em>Nothing says \'I\'ve got Lion!\' quite like a great big feline on your desktop</em></p><p>Head to System Preferences, Desktop and Screen Saver and click on Desktop pictures - you\'ll see the new Andromeda Galaxy background, which Apple uses in a lot of the pictures on its website, and of course, there\'s an actual picture of a Lion you can use as a desktop background there as well. </p><p><strong>7. Add a new space</strong></p><p>Lion changes the way Spaces works on your Mac. Previously you\'d had a Spaces settings panel in System Preferences. This has now been replaced by Mission Control. Mission Control is actually one of Lion\'s strongest features - essentially taking the idea of Exposé (an easy way to access all your open windows) and turning it into something even more useful that enables you to switch to new Spaces without touching the keyboard. </p><p>In Mission Control move your cursor to the top right hand corner and you get the option to add a new Space. Once you\'ve added a Space, Ctrl or right-click on any application icon in your Dock to force it to open in a particular Space.</p><p><strong>8. Go full screen - and get back out!</strong></p><p>Full screen apps offer a better, distraction-free, way of working. At the moment it\'s mainly Apple\'s apps, like Pages, iPhoto or iTunes that go full screen, but we\'re sure third-party apps will offer full screen options soon. Load up Safari and try it out by clicking the arrow icon in the top-right corner of the app. Unfortunately it\'s not immediately obvious how you get back out of full screen mode. There are two ways to do it. Either press the Escape key on the keyboard, or simply move the cursor to the top of the screen. The traditional Apple menu bar will appear with an option to revert back to standard windowed mode.</p><p><strong>9. Marvel at versions</strong></p><p>Versions is a very useful new feature of Lion - it combines with Auto Save to enable you to go back to any previously saved version of a file you\'ve got open. It only works in compatible apps, and again, right now that limits you to Apple\'s apps, but other will soon follow.</p><p><img alt=\"Versions\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/lionafterinstall/versions-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>LOOK BACK:</strong> <em>Step into the Time Machine-like interface of Versions to see previous versions of your documents</em></p><p>You can try it out in Text Edit or Pages - open the program and start to type something and save it. You\'ll notice a small triangle next to the document name at the top of the program window - tap this and you enter a Time Machine-like interface that enables you to skip through previous versions of the file.</p><p><strong>10. Shut down!</strong></p><p>We\'re so used to having to shut down all our applications before we shut down our Macs that we don\'t give it a second though, but with Lion all that changes. You\'ll notice a new tickbox entitled \'Reopen Windows when logging back in\'.</p><p><img alt=\"Shutdown\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/lionafterinstall/shutdown-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>END OF PLAY: </strong><em>The new shut down screen gives you the option to start up your Mac exactly as you left it </em></p><p>If you\'re running Lion right now hit Shutdown, then restart your Mac with this option ticked. You\'ll find that it starts up exactly as you left it, with this very web page you\'re reading now open in your web browser ,so you can keep on reading where you left off. That\'s pretty impressive.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16d9d441/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16d552d5/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Capple0Esells0E1m0Ecopies0Eof0Eos0Ex0Elion0Ein0Efirst0Eday0E9817390Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Apple sells 1m copies of OS X Lion in first day</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16d8d8d8/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Cmacbook0Eair0Evs0Emacbook0Epro0Ewhich0Eis0Eright0Efor0Eyou0E0E9818980Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: which is right for you?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16e8309a/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Chow0Eto0Einstall0Emac0Ememory0E9657560Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to install Mac memory</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16ee377c/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Capple0Epatents0Eflat0Ekeyless0Ekeyboard0E9836190Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Apple patents flat keyless keyboard</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16f0a668/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Capple0Elooking0Eat0E150Einch0Esuper0Eslim0Emacbook0Enext0E0E9838560Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Apple looking at 15-inch super-slim MacBook next?</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Tutorial%3A+10+things+to+do+after+installing+OS+X+Lion&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fapple%2F10-things-to-do-after-installing-os-x-lion-981912%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Tutorial%3A+10+things+to+do+after+installing+OS+X+Lion&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fapple%2F10-things-to-do-after-installing-os-x-lion-981912%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877657958/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16d9d441/kg/239-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877657958/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16d9d441/kg/239-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~4/w2JPxKS9Pd0\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~3/w2JPxKS9Pd0/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing\n',13461,NULL,'2011-07-22 13:00:00'),(59,'Buying Guide: MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: which is right for you?','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/mac/images/airvspro/airvspro-200-200.jpg\" /><p>When Apple released a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-apple-macbook-air-2011-review-981684\">new MacBook Air</a> in time for OS X Lion, it also took the chance to <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-scraps-white-macbook-981194\">cut the white MacBook</a> from its line up. This leaves buyers with a choice between the MacBook Air or a MacBook Pro.</p><p><p>But if you\'re after an Apple laptop and were thinking of getting the white MacBook, which is right for you now? The MacBook Airs and MacBook Pros have some quite significant differences, so we\'ve put together the following guide to help you decide which will fulfil your needs.</p><p>If you decide the current Apple range isn\'t right for you, also check our <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/laptops/top-laptops-the-20-best-laptops-in-the-world-706673\">top 20 laptops</a> list here.</p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Price</strong></p><p>The new MacBook Air range starts at £849 for the 11-inch, 64GB model, with the 128GB model coming in at £999. The 13-inch MacBook Air starts at £1,099 for the 128GB version, with the 256GB version costing £1,349.</p><p>The MacBook Pro range starts at £999 for the 2.3GHz 13-inch version, while the 2.7GHz model will cost you £1,299. The 15-inch models cost £1,549 and £1,849 for the 2GHz and 2.2GHz models respectively. The 17-inch model costs £2,099.</p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Processor</strong></p><p>All of Apple\'s laptops now use Intel\'s Sandy Bridge processors, so this means the latest Intel Core i5 or Core i7 CPUs. The MacBook Air\'s CPUs are all dual-core regardless of whether you\'ve got the 1.6GHz, 1.7GHz or 1.8GHz model, but they\'re Hyper-Threaded, so they have four virtual cores. </p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/apple-macbook-pro-13-2011--932364/review\">13-inch MacBook Pro</a> also features dual-core CPUs, but they\'re a lot more powerful, running at 2.3GHz or 2.7GHz. These are also both Hyper-Threaded, like the MacBook Air\'s, giving you four virtual cores. The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/apple-macbook-pro-15-2011--933990/review\">15-inch MacBook Pro</a> and 17-inch MacBook Pro feature quad-core CPUs at 2GHz, 2.2GHz or 2.3GHz. Again, these are Hyper-Threaded, giving eight virtual cores.</p><p>All of the CPUs on both the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air lines feature Turbo Boost, so can clock beyond their given speed in certain circumstances.</p><p><img alt=\"MacBook air\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/airvspro/MacBookAir_11inch_PF_Open_PRINT-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Graphics</strong></p><p>The new MacBook Airs feature the new integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000 graphics chip, which is the same as in the 13-inch MacBook Pro. In our <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/apple-macbook-pro-2011-13-inch-932364/review\">13-inch MacBook Pro review</a>, we noted that this GPU was surprisingly capable for gaming, but this is likely to be diminished in the MacBook Air because of its less powerful processor.</p><p>The 15- and 17-inch MacBook Pro models come with dedicated GPUs from AMD, with up to 1GB of video memory. This makes them far better for gamers, or those using GPU-accelerated software, including Final Cut X and Motion 5.</p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: RAM</strong></p><p>The new MacBook Airs feature the same 1333MHz DDR3 RAM as the MacBook Pro line, though the cheapest 11-inch MacBook Air only features 2GB, while all the other MacBook Air models match the MacBook Pros by having 4GB as standard.</p><p>However, the MacBook Pros can be configured to have up to 8GB of RAM, while the Airs can\'t be increased past 4GB.</p><p><img alt=\"MacBook pro\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/airvspro/MacBookPro_15inch_PF_PRINT2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Screen</strong></p><p>The 11-inch MacBook Air has a resolution of 1366 x 768, while the 13-inch MacBook Air offer 1440 x 900. This is actually higher than the 13-inch MacBook Pro, which features a 1280 x 800 screen. In fact, the 13-inch MacBook Air\'s resolution is equivalent to the 15-inch MacBook Pro\'s, which is also 1440 x 900, which could make the MacBook Air more desirable for photographers and designers than the 13-inch MacBook Pro.</p><p>That said, the MacBook Pro can be configured to have a 1680 x 1050 screen, while the 1920 x 1200 screen on the 17-inch MacBook Pro bests all the others.</p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Storage</strong></p><p>The MacBook Air range uses flash memory SSDs, making it extremely fast to turn on and to wake from sleep mode. It also helps to make it power efficient. The cheapest 11-inch MacBook Air offers 64GB of storage, while the more expensive 11-inch model offers 128GB. The 13-inch models offer 128GB or 256GB of storage.</p><p>The MacBook Pro models all feature hard drives as standard, starting from 320GB in the 13-inch to 750GB in the 17-inch model. These can be configured for larger drives though, or for faster hard drives or even SSDs up to 512GB.</p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Battery life</strong></p><p>The 11-inch MacBook Air is stated to offer up to five hours of battery life in real-word use, while the 13-inch MacBook and all of the MacBook Pro models are stated to offer up to seven hours of use. How you use them will obviously affect this – playing games using the MacBook Pros\' dedicated GPUs will causes a severe reduction in battery life.</p><p>Unlike the MacBook Pros, the MacBook Airs are designed to offer lengthy standby battery life, lasting up to 30 days without being turned off, which could be an advantage for those who won\'t get a chance to plug in their laptop that often.</p><p><img alt=\"MacBook air vs macbook pro\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/airvspro/ThunderboltDisplay_MacBookAir_13inch_34LF_PRINT-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Size and weight</strong></p><p>The 11-inch MacBook Air is considerably smaller than any of Apple\'s other laptops, but still offers nearly a full size keyboard. It measues 17mm at its thickest point when closed, and weighs 1.08kg. The 13-inch MacBook Air is the same thickness as the 11-inch model, but is wider and deeper. It weighs a little more, at 1.35kg.</p><p>The MacBook Pros are 24mm thick for the 13- and 15-inch versions, while the 17-inch is 25mm thick. They\'re all a good deal heavier too, with the 13-inch model weighing nearly twice what the 11-inch MacBook Air does at 2.04kg. The 15-inch weighs 1.54kg, while the 17-inch model is 2.99kg.</p><p>This all makes the MacBook Airs far easier to carry around with you, but it has come at the cost of storage space, and processor and graphics power.</p><p><strong>MacBook Air vs MacBook Pro: Ports</strong></p><p>The new MacBook Airs feature two USB 2.0 ports, a headphone port, an SD card slot and a Thunderbolt port. This enables them to connect to the new Thunderbolt Display to add more I/O options.</p><p>The 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros both have two USB 2.0 ports, a FireWire 800 port, Gigabit Ethernet, an audio line-out an SD card slot and a Thunderbolt port. The 15-inch model also has a line-in jack. The 17-inch model adds another USB 2.0 port and swaps the SD card slot for an ExpressCard slot.</p><p> All of the MacBook Pros feature a DVD drive, while the MacBook Airs don\'t have any disc drive at all unless you buy the SuperDrive add-on, so if you want to watch DVDs, you should take that into consideration. </p><p><img alt=\"MacBook air vs macbook pro\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/airvspro/MacBookAir_Hero_1_PRINT-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16d8d8d8/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16d552d5/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Capple0Esells0E1m0Ecopies0Eof0Eos0Ex0Elion0Ein0Efirst0Eday0E9817390Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Apple sells 1m copies of OS X Lion in first day</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16d9d441/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0C10A0Ethings0Eto0Edo0Eafter0Einstalling0Eos0Ex0Elion0E9819120Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Tutorial: 10 things to do after installing OS X Lion</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16e8309a/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Chow0Eto0Einstall0Emac0Ememory0E9657560Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to install Mac memory</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16ee377c/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Capple0Epatents0Eflat0Ekeyless0Ekeyboard0E9836190Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Apple patents flat keyless keyboard</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16f0a668/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Capple0Elooking0Eat0E150Einch0Esuper0Eslim0Emacbook0Enext0E0E9838560Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Apple looking at 15-inch super-slim MacBook next?</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Buying+Guide%3A+MacBook+Air+vs+MacBook+Pro%3A+which+is+right+for+you%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fapple%2Fmacbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-which-is-right-for-you--981898%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Buying+Guide%3A+MacBook+Air+vs+MacBook+Pro%3A+which+is+right+for+you%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fapple%2Fmacbook-air-vs-macbook-pro-which-is-right-for-you--981898%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877643282/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16d8d8d8/kg/201-216-221-253-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877643282/u/49/f/415074/c/669/s/16d8d8d8/kg/201-216-221-253-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~4/mySZOK1TfjI\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-news/~3/mySZOK1TfjI/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing\n',10936,NULL,'2011-07-22 11:05:00'),(60,'Week in Tech: It\'s a Mac, Mac, Mac, Mac world','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-2-200-200.jpg\" /><p>If you\'re not an Apple fan, we\'ve got bad news for you: pretty much all the tech news this week revolved around the Cupertino corporation. </p><p>There was a brand new OS, some brand new computers, a whole bunch of rumours and some truly staggering numbers - and those numbers might just show us the way computing is heading.</p><p>That\'s what columnist Gary Marshall <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/forget-fanboyism-follow-the-money-981011\">reckons, anyway</a>. </p><p>With Apple reporting yet another record financial quarter, Marshall noted that \"iPads are already outselling Macs... by a factor of two to one. Factor in Apple\'s staggering iPhone sales and the growing importance of the iPod touch [and] it\'s clear that Apple is a mobile device firm first and a computer firm second.\"</p><p>It\'s not just about Apple, though. It\'s about all kinds of mobile devices. \"In 2002, the number of PCs in the world reached 1 billion. That took twenty-one years,\" Marshall says. \"After just four years, the combined sales of iOS and Android are nearing the half-billion mark already... this isn\'t the end of the PC. It\'s the rebirth of the PC.\"</p><p><strong>New MacBook Air and Mac Mini</strong></p><p>While <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/iphone-5-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-721534\">iPhone 5 rumours</a> continue to spread around the net, we had more solid things to think about. Apple <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-scraps-white-macbook-981194\">killed the popular white MacBook</a> for everyone but educational customers, which is the end of an era: it was the last bit of kit Apple made in pure white, and its demise prompted teary-eyed MacFormat editor Graham Barlow to declare that \"I\'m sorry to see \'Apple white\' removed from Apple\'s Mac line-up.\"</p><p>The end of the white MacBook makes the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-apple-macbook-air-2011-review-981684\">new MacBook Air</a> the entry-level Mac laptop, and there\'s a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-announces-update-for-mac-mini-981183\">new Mac Mini</a> for those of you who don\'t need mobility. The revised Mac Mini is faster and prettier than before, and it comes without an optical drive. \"Those DVD makers must have really upset Apple somewhere along the line,\" Patrick Goss writes. </p><p>Apple clearly believes that the era of the optical disk is coming to a close, and it\'s putting its operating system where its mouth is: the new OS X Lion is download-only, although you\'ll be able to buy a pricey USB stick later this year. However, the OS has hardly got off to a slow start - <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-sells-1m-copies-of-os-x-lion-in-first-day-981739\">1 million copies have already been downloaded</a>. </p><p>As you\'d expect from us, we\'ve catered for every conceivable OS X Lion need: we\'ve got a hands-on <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-mac-os-x-lion-review-981259\">Lion review</a> from someone who discovered that Lion killed their pricey Logic Pro music software; we have a tutorial showing you how to <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/how-to-use-multi-touch-gestures-on-your-mac-973617\">get the best from multi-touch gestures</a>; we have an in-depth guide that tells you everything you need to know, including how to <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/os-x-10-7-lion-guide-get-started-with-lion-today-979099\">get your Mac ready for the update</a>, and we\'re keeping an eye on which applications have been upgraded to take advantage of Lion\'s new auto-save and file versioning features. So far that list includes Apple\'s iWork suite, which was <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/itunes-and-iwork-upgraded-for-mac-os-x-lion-981300\">updated last night</a>.</p><p>So is Lion the mane event, or a cat-astrophe? We think it\'s the former, and not just because it costs just £20.99 for every Mac you might own. However, it might be well to heed our warning: \"if you\'re using non-Apple kit or older software or hardware, we\'d recommend checking for compatibility before hitting the App Store.\" If you rely on anything to get your work done, make sure it\'s compatible. </p><p>As if that wasn\'t enough, Apple also launched the world\'s cheapest monitor. Only kidding: it\'s £899. But what a monitor it is: twenty-seven inches of <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-announces-new-thunderbolt-led-display-981178\">Apple Thunderbolt LED Display</a> with a FaceTime webcam, speakers, Gigabit Ethernet, Firewire 800, USB 2.0 and a free horse.

after posting strong results','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/images/microsoft-windows-logo-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Microsoft has posted its quarterly financial report, revealing that it made record revenues of $17.4 billion (£10.6 billion) in the three months ending in June.</p><p>The strong results are largely thanks to robust Office and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/consoles/gaming/xbox-720-every-rumour-about-the-next-xbox-937167\">Xbox</a> sales, with profits for the company up by 4 per cent to $6.2 billion (£3.8 billion). </p><p>There was particularly good news from the Xbox and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/hands-on-windows-phone-7-mango-review-958706\">Windows Phone</a> wielding entertainment and devices division, which made nearly $32 million in profit - a far rosier picture than a year ago when it posted massive losses of $172 million. </p><p><strong>Party hats all round?</strong></p><p>While the champagne corks may be popping at Redmond for now, there could be a bumpy road ahead; the seemingly healthy entertainment and devices department is actually in its second quarter of decline.</p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft\'s shares have also fallen over fears that demand for the Windows operating system and associated software is low. </p><p>Although the worldwide PC market has grown by nearly 2%, the Windows division\'s revenues are down by 1% compared to the same time last year - however, with <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/pc/computing/computing-components/operating-systems/software/windows-8-everything-you-need-to-know-701764\">Windows 8</a> just around the corner, the situation could be reversed within a year. </p><p>Another problem area for Microsoft seems to be the online services department, which includes search engine Bing and all its cloud-based products, where it made a big loss. </p><p>Comparisons to the once-underdog Apple are inevitable; Jobs and co <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/apple/computing/apple-smashes-20m-iphone-sales-barrier-in-q3-980874\">posted net profits of $7.31 billion</a> (£4.53 billion) for the same quarter; not only is that higher than Microsoft\'s record report, but Apple\'s revenues were a 125 per cent improvement, while Microsoft\'s are up only 8 per cent. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

Air 2011 review','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookairhero-200-200.jpg\" /><p>The MacBook Air that debuted last October was a mighty fine-looking piece of hardware - a newly designed unibody shell, 0.3cm at its thinnest. </p><p>Trouble is, the meat inside didn\'t quite match up with the supreme exterior – Apple had been forced to stick with the ageing Intel Core 2 Duo processor.</p><p>Intel had originally produced a special, smaller packaged Core 2 Duo variant for the first-generation MacBook Air that was still clinging on in last year\'s release. </p><p><p>The small processor package, presumably, couldn\'t be bettered until this year\'s Sandy Bridge generation of Intel Core chips. </p><p>So here we are with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-announces-beefed-up-macbook-air-range-981173\">newly-launched</a> 2011 MacBook Air running the day-old Mac OS X 10.7 Lion - featuring all new processors. </p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-10-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The great news is that the new models don\'t lack for performance. Even the base models are stacked. The off-the-shelf models come with the blistering Core i5 1.6 (11-inch, £849/£999 depending on memory and SSD) or 1.7 Ghz (13-inch, £1,099/£1,349 depending on memory and SSD) variants. </p><p>Even better is that, for an extra £100 you can pop a 1.8GHz Core i7 into the high-end 13-inch (it\'s £150 to pop it into the high end 11-inch) and that is what is inside the 13-inch MacBook Air Apple has been kind enough to loan us here. (It\'s the 7-2677M, if you\'re a code aficionado.) </p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Moving centre stage</strong></p><p>The model we have in our hands is seriously quick, though having used numerous Sandy Bridge Core i5s including the new <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/apple-macbook-pro-13-2011--932364/review\">2011 MacBook Pro</a>, we\'re confident the performance of those machines won\'t disappoint.</p><p>Whichever you choose, the MacBook Air is certainly no longer the poor-powered portable Mac – indeed, Apple has so much faith in it that it has discontinued the MacBook for retail purchase (it\'s still going to be available for education, apparently). </p><p>The MacBook Air is expensive of course, but you get what you pay for. </p><p>As with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/apple-macbook-pro-13-2011--932364/review\">new MacBook Pros</a>, the new MacBook Air also adopts the Intel-gestated Thunderbolt technology - again manifesting in a DisplayPort connection. Various Thunderbolt products will launch in due course, but in the meantime Apple has also released a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-announces-new-thunderbolt-led-display-981178\">new Apple Thunderbolt Display</a> which is a thorn in our theory that thunderbolt is just a gimmick. </p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-9-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>You see, the monitor acts as a docking station for the MacBook Air. There\'s Gigabit Ethernet, USB ports and FireWire – and it all connects over the Thunderbolt connection along with the video of course! We have to say, the idea of having Thunderbolt as a single point of docking connectivity is mighty appealing – even if the display is a monstrous £899.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/intel-thunderbolt-in-apple-macbook-pro-explained-931050\">Intel Thunderbolt explained</a></p><p><strong>Which should you choose? </strong></p><p>Although the 13-inch MacBook Air is a lot more usable for most workhorse tasks, the 11-inch MacBook Air is still a highly capable machine for most purposes. The displays remain the same as the last generation, though what they\'re driven by is different.</p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Graphics is now provided by Intel\'s HD 3000 graphics built into the new Core chips rather than the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia\" title=\"Nvidia\">Nvidia</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce\" title=\"GeForce\">GeForce</a> 320M used in the last generation. While Intel\'s Sandy Bridge graphics are fine for most needs, if it\'s supreme graphics performance you want than you need a MacBook Pro. </p><p>In terms of pixels, the 11-inch is a 16:9 1366 × 768 panel, while the 13-inch is 16:10 - 1440 × 900.</p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-6-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>All the memory is solid state as with the last generation, and the 11-inch comes with either 64GB or 128GB while the 13-inch provides either 128GB or 256GB depending on model. You can have up to 4GB of DDR3 memory.</p><p>One of the most annoying things about the last MacBook Air was that a compromise had had to be made about the backlit keyboard – it disappeared to the chagrin of many potential purchasers. Thankfully, it is now well and truly back.</p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-4-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>As you\'d expect from any Apple notebook, there\'s the glass Multi-Touch trackpad that supports Lion\'s multi-touch gestures.</p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>There\'s also support for Bluetooth 4.0 should you be interested in that, while you also get the standard Apple webcam (not HD) and an SD card in the 13-inch which was introduced with the last generation. As then, there isn\'t the space to include one in the 11-inch. </p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-9-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Weight is comparable to the last generation of the Air at 1.08Kg for the 11-inch and 1.34Kg for the 13-inch. It seems strange that the MacBook Air has become Apple\'s entry-level notebook. But that\'s what has happened. </p><p>If you can spare the not-inconsiderable cash, its one hell of a power portable whichever model you decide to plump for. </p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air

webcam for Mac: 5 tested','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20234/MAC234.rev_cams.webcams-200-200.jpg\" /><p>All Mac notebooks, iMacs and Apple displays have a built-in iSight, FaceTime or FaceTime HD camera. Positioned directly above the screen, it\'s great for keeping in touch using apps such as iChat and FaceTime. </p><p><p>But what if your monitor doesn\'t have an internal camera, or you want to show a wider view of yourself? Apple no longer produces the external iSight, but there are third-party webcams that work brilliantly with Macs. Here we look at five webcams for your Mac. </p><p>Also, to get more from your webcam, you can buy the iGlasses app. It gives extra controls for brightness, contrast, colour balance, orientation and more. It\'s due an update, but we\'re promised iGlasses 3 is on the way. </p><p>So what\'s the best Mac webcam? Let\'s find out.</p><p><strong>01. Liquid Digital Solutions aGent V5 HD - £56 </strong><br /><a href=\"http://agent.liquiddigital.com.au/\">agent.liquiddigital.com.au</a> </p><p>This full HD, 2MP webcam resembles the old Apple iSight. It comes bundled with clips and stands, and as its screw-in mounting is the same size as a standard camera\'s, you can also use a regular tripod. </p><p><img alt=\"agent v5 hd\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/aGent_V5_HD-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>A bundled CD is full of optional apps such as Webcam Monitor, CamGrabber and Gawker. The webcam\'s design is minimal - it even lacks an LED to tell you when it\'s activated. </p><p>The five-layer German lens does a great job with stills and video, recording sharp, detailed images, even in poor light. Unfortunately, sound quality is poor, and we had to turn the input volume right up to use it, and then it suffered from hiss. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 4/5 </strong></p><p>Good looks and excellent image quality, but if you want sound too, you\'d better use a separate mic. </p><p><strong>02. Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 - £60 </strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/en-gb\">www.logitech.com/en-gb </a></p><p>This one puts in a stellar performance. Colours are more natural than the aGent V5 HD, and it handles motion well. It adjusts for sub-optimal lighting conditions, though it can look a little yellow when natural and artificial light is mixed. </p><p><img alt=\"Logitech hd pro c910\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/logitech-hd-pro-webcam-c910-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p>Its sound is as good as its video, with built-in stereo mics. Given the specifications, it\'s no wonder its performance is so impressive. </p><p>The C910 has a Carl Zeiss lens, and takes 10MP stills. It\'s full HD, and you can make video calls in 720p. One-click upload to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter is also catered for. Unfortunately, its non-removable stand isn\'t very versatile, and it doesn\'t look Mac-like.</p><p> <strong>Verdict: 4.5/5</strong></p><p>Excellent performance, with great video and sound. We wish it had a screw-mounting, though.</p><p> <strong>03. Blue Microphones Eyeball 2.0 - £35 </strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.bluemic.com/eyeball/\">www.bluemic.com/eyeball </a></p><p>You can tell at a glance where the Eyeball 2.0\'s priorities lie. Most webcams add a microphone as an afterthought, but the Eyeball 2.0 is built around its mic, with the camera positioned on a retractable arm that pops out of its spherical body. </p><p><img alt=\"Eyeball 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/blue_mic_eyeball-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p>As a result, audio quality is good, capturing voices clearly without picking up background noise. Yet for all its acoustic strengths, the Eyeball 2.0\'s video was the worst of all the cameras on test.</p><p> Despite a 1600x1200 resolution, it lacked sharpness and clarity, and video was marred by motion blur. It copes with low light well, but its overall performance is poor. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 2.5/5 </strong></p><p>Good audio, but this can\'t make up for the Eyeball 2.0\'s awful video quality. Horrible motion blur.</p><p> <strong>04. Macally IceCam2 - £17 </strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.macally.com/\">www.macally.com </a></p><p>If you\'re looking for a less expensive choice that does a decent job with the minimum of fuss, then this is your cam. It\'s plug-and-play, with no bundled software or drivers, and its 640x480 VGA resolution is more than enough for video chat. </p><p><img alt=\"IceCam2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/icecam2-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p>Its monitor/desktop stand and swivel head are functional, as is its long USB cable. Naturally, the video quality can\'t match the HD heavyweights. It\'s not as crisp, it needs to be manually focussed and there\'s significant motion blur when the light\'s poor. </p><p>The sound echoes a little, and audio and video are sometimes slightly out of sync. It\'s not for connoisseurs, but if all you want is basic video chat, the IceCam2 puts in a robust, if workmanlike, performance. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 3/5 </strong></p><p>Surprisingly capable considering the price, and certainly good enough for basic video chat. </p><p><strong>05. Ecamm BT-1 - £110</strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.ecamm.com/\">www.ecamm.com </a></p><p>The Ecamm BT-1\'s selling point is Bluetooth. With no USB cable, you can place the BT-1 anywhere within 30 feet of your computer, even in another room. Its supplied telescopic tripod uses a standard camera mounting screw, and its rechargeable battery lasts around four hours. There\'s nothing to mount it on a monitor, but that\'s not its intended use.</p><p><img alt=\"Ecamm bt1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/ecamm_bt-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p> The BT-1 offers a maximum 640x480 resolution. Its colours are muted and it lacks sharpness and clarity, though there\'s very little motion blur. The mic does a decent job, capturing sound without picking up background noise. </p><p>It struggles to focus close in, but manages much better at longer distances. It\'s not yet compatible with FaceTime but we\'ve been assured that an update is coming soon. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 3.5/5 </strong></p><p>Not ideal for putting on your monitor, but great for when cables won\'t reach.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16d0f46d/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td

another bumper Intel quarter','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/logos/intel-logo-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Intel has announced another quarter of record profit, with CEO Paul Otellini pointing to the growth of mobile devices as a key factor in the chip giant\'s growth. </p><p>Intel surpassed $13.1 billion (£8.1bn) in revenue for the second quarter of 2011, with servers, strong demand for high-end Core chips and the continued growth of mobile devices all cited. </p><p>\"We achieved a significant new milestone in the second quarter, surpassing $13.0 billion in revenue for the first time,\" said Paul Otellini, Intel president and CEO. </p><p><strong>Advanced tech</strong></p><p>\"Strong corporate demand for our most advanced technology, the surge of mobile devices and Internet traffic fueling data centre growth, and the rapid rise of computing in emerging markets drove record results. </p><p>\"Intel\'s 23 percent revenue growth in the first half and our increasing confidence in the second half of 2011 position us to grow annual revenue in the mid-20 percent range.\"</p><p>Interestingly, Intel stated that newly acquired McAfee and Inineon Wireless Solutions (not Intel Mobile Communications) contributed $1 billion in their first full-quarter of results. </p><p>Breaking the results down further, Intel\'s PC client group had revenue up 11 per cent year on year, its Data Server group reported a 15 percent increase and Embedded & Communications Group saw a 25 per cent increase. </p><p>One sour note was the waning impact of the mobile Atom processor and chipsets, which saw revenues drop by 15 per cent. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415074/s/16d0c29f/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table

It promises to bring the best of iOS back to the Mac, and there are some interesting new features too. So is it worth the budget price of £20.99?</p><p>We\'d say yes, but only if your apps will work on it: for example, we found Logic Pro 8 refused to launch once we\'d upgraded; if we were musicians rather than writers, that would have been a disaster. As it is, we suspect an update won\'t be forthcoming, and Logic isn\'t exactly cheap. </p><p>Expect other irregularities too. Lion decided it didn\'t like our mouse, and decided not to recognise our magic trackpad in a fit of pique. </p><p>These are the joys of early adoption: if you\'re using non-Apple kit or older software or hardware, we\'d recommend checking for compatibility before hitting the App Store. Adobe has already published <a href=\"http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/905/cpsid_90508.html\">a list of issues</a> and other firms are likely to follow suit.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/aaaaagh-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>COMPATIBILITY: </strong><em>Make sure your favourite apps are compatible before upgrading. This message is going to cost us about £170</em></p><p><strong>Lion\'s user interface</strong></p><p>The new interface is a nice place to be, provided you don\'t like colour: Apple has leached the colour out of OS X, with the odd blue progress bar lost in a world of endless greys. You\'ll probably encounter a few minor irritations too, such as the enormous text size in the Finder sidebar and Mail\'s folder list; you can fix that by going to System Preferences > General > Sidebar Icon Size. </p><p>While you\'re in System Preferences you might want to change another thing - the mouse and trackpad settings, which are set to move content in the direction of finger movement when you scroll - and then use View > Customize to remove any System Preferences icons you don\'t need.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/sysprefgrabs-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>SYSTEM ICONS:</strong> <em>Get rid of icons you don\'t need in System Preferences with the handy Customize option</em></p><p>Windows are now resizable from any edge and scrollbars have become dinky grey lines, and if your app supports Lion\'s new full screen mode - for now, most don\'t - you\'ll see a double-arrow icon at the top right of the application window. Clicking it takes you into full screen mode and Esc takes you out again. Moving the mouse or trackpad to the top of the screen when you\'re in full screen mode displays the menu bar.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/fullscreen-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>FULL SCREEN: </strong><em>iPhoto is great in full-screen mode on a 27-inch iMac. Mail, not so much</em></p><p><strong>Mission Control and Launchpad</strong></p><p>The new Launchpad screen addresses the issue of finding applications that aren\'t in the Dock without having to wander around your Mac\'s hard disk, and uses a distinctly iOS-like interface to display all your application icons and folders. If you\'re used to a dedicated launcher you\'ll hate it, but if you aren\'t - or if you\'re new to the Mac altogether - then it makes perfect sense.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/launchpad1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>LAUNCHPAD:</strong> <em>Launchpad bridges the gap between the Dock and faffing around in Finder. Non-geeks will love it</em></p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/launchpad2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>FOLDER SUPPORT:</strong> <em>Launchpad supports folders too, so things never get too cluttered on screen</em></p><p>Mission Control, on the other hand, is more for power users. A hot corner, function key or multi-touch swipe displays your open applications, your applications\' windows, any full-screen apps, Dashboard widgets (optionally) and Spaces, enabling you to quickly find what you\'re looking for. The interface is in 3D, too, albeit subtly.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/missioncontrol-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>MISSION CONTROL:</strong> <em>Spaces, Dashboard and Expose together in one happy 3D family</em></p><p><strong>Lion\'s default apps</strong></p><p>The revised Calendar and Address Book apps look like their iPad equivalents, which has already divided opinion. We think they\'re horrible, but we\'ll get used to them. </p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/addressgrab-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong> IPADALIKE: </strong><em>Address Book gets an iPad-style makeover. It\'s a rare blast of colour in Lion\'s mainly grey palette</em></p><p>Mail\'s iPad-style overhaul is much more successful, with grouped conversations and a distinctly minimalist UI. The folder list is hidden by default but you can unhide it with a click if you miss it.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/mailgrab-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>NEW MAIL: </strong><em>The redesigned Mail app is more useful than before, and once again there\'s a strong iOS influence to its UI</em></p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/calgrab-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>NOT KEEN: </strong><em>The new Calendar looks like the iPad one. We don\'t like that one\'s interface either</em></p><p>Safari gets some under-the-hood enhancements including a newer version of the WebKit rendering engine and improved security against browser exploits, and the downloads window has been replaced by an iOS-style toolbar icon and pop-up.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x lion\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/safaridownloads-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>DOWNLOADS:</strong> <em>Safari\'s Downloads window is no more. Instead, there\'s a toolbar icon with a pop-up, shown here</em></p><p>The big new feature, though, is Instapaper - er, Reading List. Whenever you see something interesting online, just click the Read Later - er, Reading List\'s Add Page button - and then load it up in Instapaper - er, Safari - when you\'ve got time to read it. Come iOS 5 you\'ll be able to sync your Reading List with your iOS devices, just like you can with that program whose name starts with I and ends with \"nstapaper\".</p><p><img alt=\"Reading list\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/readinglist-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Then there\'s DropBox - er, AirDrop. Like DropBox it enables you to drop files to other computers, although for now it\'s a Lion-only feature (DropBox is multi-platform). It benefits from a typically pretty Apple UI, but if you\'re already using DropBox there\'s nothing particularly exciting here.</p><p><strong>Versions and AutoSave</strong></p><p>Lion introduces a new way of saving data, although your apps will need to be updated to support it: files are saved automatically with no input from you, and once you\'ve given your file a name you\'ll see Save a Version in the File menu instead of Save. Clicking on a file title in its menu bar then gives you the option to lock a file so it\'s no longer autosaved; to revert to the last saved version; or to browse all the different versions, which launches a Time Machine interface for that specific document.</p><p><img alt=\"Versioning\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/osx-lion/versioning-230-100.jpg\" width=\"230\" /></p><p><strong>VERSIONING: </strong><em>If your apps have been updated to support it, Lion will automatically save and track files for you</em></p><p>It works very well, but it\'ll be a while until it filters through to all your apps - and probably even longer before you trust it, because it feels really weird not hitting Command-S all the time. The autosave also means that if you accidentally quit a program, you can just reopen it and pick up from where you left off - and when you log out, your Mac will ask if you want to restore your open apps when you log back in. </p><p><strong>Verdict</strong></p><p> This is a hands-on rather than a full review, but it\'s clear that there\'s enough in Lion to make it a must-purchase for most Mac users -

Depending on what Mac you\'ve got, you may need to take out the existing RAM to put more in, so bear this in mind when you\'re buying. If your MacBook Pro already has two 1GB chips (one in each slot) and you want to upgrade to 4GB, you can\'t simply buy an additional 2GB. Check System Profiler for what you\'ve got now. </p><p>The best place to get memory from is <a href=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/techradar/www.crucial.com/uk\">Crucial</a>, which has a simple guide to ensure you buy the right RAM for your Mac. </p><p>To prevent static charge damaging your equipment, ground yourself before you begin by touching something metal. Unplug all power sources before you open things up. Get an anti-static wristband from an electronics shop for peace of mind. </p><p>When handling RAM, hold it by the edges and don\'t touch the gold connectors.

You can also use the arrow keys on their own to move the cursor around, so no more dragging your finger and squinting at the on-screen magnifier to position it. </p><p>Apple sells a dock for the original iPad with a keyboard attached to it, but a Bluetooth model gives you more freedom, both in terms of the devices you can use it with (these keyboards should work with Macs and PCs, too) and when it comes to your setup. </p><p>So you could pop your iPhone in a dock on a shelf at eye-height and the keyboard on your desk. Or, when you\'re on the train with your iPad, stand it on the table and pop the keyboard just in front. The possibilities are endless, and you\'ll be able to type away for hours, provided you pick the right keyboard for your needs. </p><p>Do you need something that\'s small and easy to slip into a bag, or does size not matter, so long as you can type on it for long periods? Four of these run on batteries, so make sure you carry spares with you. The only exception is the iGo, which has built-in batteries that charge using a micro-USB connection. Lastly, the iGo Bluetooth Keyboard was also formerly known as the Adapt ADK-200; some sites still sell it as this. </p><p><strong>What we tested... </strong></p><p><strong>Apple Wireless Keyboard - £57</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Apple wireless keyboard\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keys_apple-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Freedom i-Connex - £60 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"i-Connex\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.iconnex-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>iGo Bluetooth Keyboard - £62 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"iGo\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keys_key2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>KeySonic KSK-3201MacBT - £38 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"KeySonic ksk\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keys_keysonic-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Macally BTKeyMini - £70 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Macally\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.macally-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><img alt=\"iConnex\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.iconnex-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>We spent long periods typing on each of these keyboards to find out just how usable they are for extended reams of prose. How comfortable are they on the fingers? How fast can you type and how many mistakes do you make? </p><p>To be able to type quickly and without errors, you need the keys to be where you\'d expect them to be, especially things like the punctuation and numbers. And in trying to squash so many keys into a small and folding unit, the i-Connex becomes tricky to use. </p><p>We found ourselves making a lot of mistakes, and to compound matters, then missed the very small backspace key. The number keys along the top aren\'t exactly where you expect them to be in relation to the rest of the keys, either. </p><p>The KeySonic model, on the other hand, despite the key area being the same size as the i-Connex, is simply a slightly shrunk version of a full computer keyboard, and is far easier to use. We quickly found ourselves typing away at speed, with few mistakes. The action of the keys is wonderfully light and they\'re all where you\'d expect them to be. </p><p>The same is true for the Apple model, although the keys are in fact the same size as a regular computer keyboard, so you won\'t need to get used to a smaller size – simply set it up and start typing. Again, the key action is perfect – just enough resistance to let you know you\'ve pressed the keys, but light enough not to place too much strain on your fingers. </p><p>The Macally keyboard, despite being very light and compact, doesn\'t lend itself to fast or error-free typing (you\'d be amazed at the number of errors we made typing this sentence alone on it). Like the i-Connex, in squashing all the keys into a small space, Macally has taken liberties with key placement, most irritating of which is the apostrophe. While it\'s not far from where you\'d expect it, we kept hitting Enter instead – intensely annoying. </p><p>Lastly, the iGo has also shifted a couple of keys around, and indeed done away with the right Shift key altogether, causing much angst for your Mario Teaches Typing-trained reviewer. But since the majority of keys are where you\'d expect them to be, and because the key action is just so pleasant, we actually found ourselves rather liking the keyboard. The slightly rubberised keytops feel great to type on and the action is the lightest of all those on test here – something for which our RSI-prone fingers were thankful. </p><p><strong>Test results</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Test 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/test1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Apple\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keys_apple-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>When it came to portability, we looked at the size of the keyboard, of course, but also at how rugged they felt and how comfortable we were shoving them into a rucksack. Keyboards are notoriously susceptible to crumbs and other junk getting stuck under the keys, so it\'s important you shield them in your bag.</p><p> In this respect, the KeySonic and Apple will need some form of protection – such as a sleeve – to ensure that dust doesn\'t get anywhere it shouldn\'t. It\'s also worth noting that these two are both (largely) white, so the dirt that they\'ll inevitably come into contact with is more likely to show up on them. </p><p>The Macally, iGo and i-Connex keyboards are all black and generally better designed for flinging quickly into bags without too much care. The first comes with a protective case that doubles as a stand for your device – a really good idea for when you\'re on the road and need to prop up your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch but don\'t want to lug around even more kit. </p><p>Whichever device we plonked into the stand stayed upright firmly (which is more than could be said for some other, achem, stand-alone stands we\'ve tried). And the i-Connex protects itself from dust in your bag by folding in half, though there is still a gap between the two segments where stuff can get in. </p><p>The iGo is probably the best when it comes to portability, though, because its keys are sealed around the edges, so no dust can make its way where it\'s not wanted. Add to this that it\'s the thinnest and lightest package on test here and you\'ve got pretty much the ultimate portable travel companion. </p><p>The only small issue we found was that the rubberised surface on the front and back did attract dust and other unwanted junk, which, while not affecting performance, doesn\'t do much for the aesthetics. </p><p><strong>Test results </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Test 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/test2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong><img alt=\"Keysonic\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keysonic2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><br /></strong></p><p><strong>KeySonic KSK-3201MacBT - £38 </strong></p><p><strong>Whether it\'s a text, email or thesis you want to type, this little keyboard will be your best friend </strong></p><p>The fact that you\'re considering getting an external keyboard for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch suggests you\'re having to do a fair bit of typing on it. </p><p>With that in mind, let\'s get one thing clear: go for the very best there is for long-form typing. Your fingers (and stress levels) will thank you. Because of this, we can\'t recommend the Macally, even though we like the stand it comes with. As a keyboard, it\'s simply too small and typing on it produces too many errors. </p><p>Similarly, while we like the full-size main keys on the Freedom i-Connex and its folding design, its unintuitively positioned keys – notably backspace – caused our stress levels to rise considerably while we were using it. Not what you need when you\'re trying to hammer out that essay or meeting plan with only a few minutes spare.</p><p> Indeed, it\'s this irritating moving around of keys that does for the iGo as well – not to mention its omission of the right Shift key – because it\'s otherwise really nice to type on and almost flawless when it comes to portability. </p><p>So with the choice between one keyboard with full-size keys (Apple) and another with smaller ones (KeySonic), you might think that we\'d go for the former, based on how easy it would be to type on. But in practice, we didn\'t find that the smaller keys on the KeySonic hampered us at all. In fact, when it comes to portability, its smaller size and slightly lighter weight are virtues. </p><p>Even if you do plan to use it mainly just sitting at your desk, the smaller footprint leaves you more space for your papers, stationary holders and photos of your nearest and dearest. The other big thing the KeySonic\'s got going for it is its price. It\'s £20 cheaper than the Apple model, but you don\'t feel that you\'re compromising on style or quality. </p><p>Even though it\'s plastic, it still looks the part alongside your iOS device and feels robust and durable. Sure the little trackball and mouse buttons are (currently?) useless with iOS, but you could also pair this keyboard with a media centre PC or Mac to let you control it from your sofa.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16ddb823/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15a2f311/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Chands0Eon0Easus0Erog0Evulcan0Eanc0Ereview0E9615730Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Hands on: Asus RoG Vulcan ANC review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15ffb3e2/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0Eall0Ein0Eone0Eprinter0E80Ereviewed0Eand0Erated0E9656650Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best all in one printer: 8 reviewed and rated</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/1600bba8/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0E20E10Espeaker0Esystems0E60Esets0Etested0E96580A40Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best 2.1 speaker systems: 6 sets tested</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16d11ef8/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0Emac0Ewebcam0Efor0Emac0E50Etested0E9684270Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best Mac webcam for Mac: 5 tested</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Best+Bluetooth+iPad+keyboard%3A+5+reviewed&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fperipherals%2Fbest-bluetooth-ipad-keyboard-5-reviewed-980696%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Best+Bluetooth+iPad+keyboard%3A+5+reviewed&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fperipherals%2Fbest-bluetooth-ipad-keyboard-5-reviewed-980696%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877523167/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/16ddb823/kg/221-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877523167/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/16ddb823/kg/221-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~4/kwMOq7AqDAo\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~3/kwMOq7AqDAo/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing-components\n',12757,NULL,'2011-07-23 09:00:00'),(75,'Sapphire\'s Pure Platinum A75 mainboard in production','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/upgrades-and-peripherals/motherboards/images/sapphire_PLATINUM_A75_Box_Card-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Hong Kong-based Sapphire Technology has announced its latest A-series Fusion APU-based mainboard, with the Pure Platinum A75 taking advantage of AMD\'s latest chip. </p><p>It combines a quad core CPU, the northbridge and DirectX11 graphics in one handy package.</p><p>The full ATX board naturally includes HD, Blu-Ray and stereoscopic 3D support, and outputs via DVI, HDMI and DisplayPort.

Positioned directly above the screen, it\'s great for keeping in touch using apps such as iChat and FaceTime. </p><p><p>But what if your monitor doesn\'t have an internal camera, or you want to show a wider view of yourself? Apple no longer produces the external iSight, but there are third-party webcams that work brilliantly with Macs. Here we look at five webcams for your Mac. </p><p>Also, to get more from your webcam, you can buy the iGlasses app. It gives extra controls for brightness, contrast, colour balance, orientation and more. It\'s due an update, but we\'re promised iGlasses 3 is on the way. </p><p>So what\'s the best Mac webcam? Let\'s find out.</p><p><strong>01. Liquid Digital Solutions aGent V5 HD - £56 </strong><br /><a href=\"http://agent.liquiddigital.com.au/\">agent.liquiddigital.com.au</a> </p><p>This full HD, 2MP webcam resembles the old Apple iSight. It comes bundled with clips and stands, and as its screw-in mounting is the same size as a standard camera\'s, you can also use a regular tripod. </p><p><img alt=\"agent v5 hd\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/aGent_V5_HD-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>A bundled CD is full of optional apps such as Webcam Monitor, CamGrabber and Gawker. The webcam\'s design is minimal - it even lacks an LED to tell you when it\'s activated. </p><p>The five-layer German lens does a great job with stills and video, recording sharp, detailed images, even in poor light. Unfortunately, sound quality is poor, and we had to turn the input volume right up to use it, and then it suffered from hiss. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 4/5 </strong></p><p>Good looks and excellent image quality, but if you want sound too, you\'d better use a separate mic. </p><p><strong>02. Logitech HD Pro Webcam C910 - £60 </strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.logitech.com/en-gb\">www.logitech.com/en-gb </a></p><p>This one puts in a stellar performance. Colours are more natural than the aGent V5 HD, and it handles motion well. It adjusts for sub-optimal lighting conditions, though it can look a little yellow when natural and artificial light is mixed. </p><p><img alt=\"Logitech hd pro c910\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/logitech-hd-pro-webcam-c910-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p>Its sound is as good as its video, with built-in stereo mics. Given the specifications, it\'s no wonder its performance is so impressive. </p><p>The C910 has a Carl Zeiss lens, and takes 10MP stills. It\'s full HD, and you can make video calls in 720p. One-click upload to Facebook, YouTube and Twitter is also catered for. Unfortunately, its non-removable stand isn\'t very versatile, and it doesn\'t look Mac-like.</p><p> <strong>Verdict: 4.5/5</strong></p><p>Excellent performance, with great video and sound. We wish it had a screw-mounting, though.</p><p> <strong>03. Blue Microphones Eyeball 2.0 - £35 </strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.bluemic.com/eyeball/\">www.bluemic.com/eyeball </a></p><p>You can tell at a glance where the Eyeball 2.0\'s priorities lie. Most webcams add a microphone as an afterthought, but the Eyeball 2.0 is built around its mic, with the camera positioned on a retractable arm that pops out of its spherical body. </p><p><img alt=\"Eyeball 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/blue_mic_eyeball-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p>As a result, audio quality is good, capturing voices clearly without picking up background noise. Yet for all its acoustic strengths, the Eyeball 2.0\'s video was the worst of all the cameras on test.</p><p> Despite a 1600x1200 resolution, it lacked sharpness and clarity, and video was marred by motion blur. It copes with low light well, but its overall performance is poor. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 2.5/5 </strong></p><p>Good audio, but this can\'t make up for the Eyeball 2.0\'s awful video quality. Horrible motion blur.</p><p> <strong>04. Macally IceCam2 - £17 </strong><br /><a href=\"http://www.macally.com/\">www.macally.com </a></p><p>If you\'re looking for a less expensive choice that does a decent job with the minimum of fuss, then this is your cam. It\'s plug-and-play, with no bundled software or drivers, and its 640x480 VGA resolution is more than enough for video chat. </p><p><img alt=\"IceCam2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/icecam2-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p>Its monitor/desktop stand and swivel head are functional, as is its long USB cable. Naturally, the video quality can\'t match the HD heavyweights. It\'s not as crisp, it needs to be manually focussed and there\'s significant motion blur when the light\'s poor. </p><p>The sound echoes a little, and audio and video are sometimes slightly out of sync. It\'s not for connoisseurs, but if all you want is basic video chat, the IceCam2 puts in a robust, if workmanlike, performance. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 3/5 </strong></p><p>Surprisingly capable considering the price, and certainly good enough for basic video chat. </p><p><strong>05. Ecamm BT-1 - £110</strong><br /> <a href=\"http://www.ecamm.com/\">www.ecamm.com </a></p><p>The Ecamm BT-1\'s selling point is Bluetooth. With no USB cable, you can place the BT-1 anywhere within 30 feet of your computer, even in another room. Its supplied telescopic tripod uses a standard camera mounting screw, and its rechargeable battery lasts around four hours. There\'s nothing to mount it on a monitor, but that\'s not its intended use.</p><p><img alt=\"Ecamm bt1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/peripherals/images/mac_webcams/ecamm_bt-320-100.jpg\" width=\"320\" /></p><p> The BT-1 offers a maximum 640x480 resolution. Its colours are muted and it lacks sharpness and clarity, though there\'s very little motion blur. The mic does a decent job, capturing sound without picking up background noise. </p><p>It struggles to focus close in, but manages much better at longer distances. It\'s not yet compatible with FaceTime but we\'ve been assured that an update is coming soon. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 3.5/5 </strong></p><p>Not ideal for putting on your monitor, but great for when cables won\'t reach.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16d11ef8/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a

record profit, with CEO Paul Otellini pointing to the growth of mobile devices as a key factor in the chip giant\'s growth. </p><p>Intel surpassed $13.1 billion (£8.1bn) in revenue for the second quarter of 2011, with servers, strong demand for high-end Core chips and the continued growth of mobile devices all cited. </p><p>\"We achieved a significant new milestone in the second quarter, surpassing $13.0 billion in revenue for the first time,\" said Paul Otellini, Intel president and CEO. </p><p><strong>Advanced tech</strong></p><p>\"Strong corporate demand for our most advanced technology, the surge of mobile devices and Internet traffic fueling data centre growth, and the rapid rise of computing in emerging markets drove record results. </p><p>\"Intel\'s 23 percent revenue growth in the first half and our increasing confidence in the second half of 2011 position us to grow annual revenue in the mid-20 percent range.\"</p><p>Interestingly, Intel stated that newly acquired McAfee and Inineon Wireless Solutions (not Intel Mobile Communications) contributed $1 billion in their first full-quarter of results. </p><p>Breaking the results down further, Intel\'s PC client group had revenue up 11 per cent year on year, its Data Server group reported a 15 percent increase and Embedded & Communications Group saw a 25 per cent increase. </p><p>One sour note was the waning impact of the mobile Atom processor and chipsets, which saw revenues drop by 15 per cent. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16d0e41b/mf.gif\"

Vista requires 15GB of free hard drive space, and Windows 7 requires 16GB.</p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 screenshots\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2829%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Given that there\'s been no real jump in requirements from Windows Vista to 7 (unlike the jump from XP to Vista, where XP required a 233MHz processor and 64MB of RAM) we\'d expect Windows 8 to happily run on a system that can run Windows 7.</p><p>On 13 July 2011, Microsoft <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/windows-8-to-have-same-system-requirements-as-windows-7-978734\">confirmed our assumption that Windows 8 would have the same system requirements as Windows 7</a>. At Microsoft\'s Worldwide Partner Conference, Corporate VP of Windows Tami Reller talked about \"continuing on with the important trend that we started with Windows 7, keeping system requirements either flat or reducing them over time.\" </p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 screenshots\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2818%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>On 18 May 2011, Intel confirmed that there will be <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/intel-confirms-dual-editions-of-windows-8-957064\">separate editions of Windows 8 that run on ARM processors and versions that require Intel\'s own chips</a>. The Windows 8 ARM editions will be tailored to mobile devices and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/windows-8-tablets-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-916134\">Windows 8 tablets</a>. The Intel versions of Windows 8 will feature a Windows 7 compatibility mode, while ARM versions won\'t.</p><p>However, the following day, Windows President Steven Sinofsky said that Intel\'s statements were \"<a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/intel-factually-inaccurate-about-windows-8-says-microsoft-957289\">factually inaccurate and unfortunately misleading</a>.\" Sinofsky didn\'t elaborate on how the statements were inaccurate, simply saying \"[We] have emphasized that we are at the technology demonstration stage. As such, we have no further details or information at this time.\"</p><p><strong>Windows 8 price</strong></p><p>Windows 7 Home Premium costs £99 for an upgrade copy and £149 for the full version. Expect the Windows 8 price to be similar.</p><p><strong>Windows 8 interface</strong></p><p>In March 2011, we reported that Windows 8 could offer a cut-down version of its user interface, taking on some design elements from the Windows Phone 7 UI in the form of <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/slimmed-down-aero-lite-ui-set-for-windows-8-936411\">Aero Lite</a>. And it appears that prediction was correct - what we\'ve seen looks a lot like Windows Phone. Indeed, it essentially is Windows Phone. </p><p>And, what\'s more, you can swipe between any of the interfaces in a cycle - and that includes traditional apps on the Windows desktop. </p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 screenshots\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2810%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>\"Fast, fluid and dynamic, the experience has been transformed while keeping the power, flexibility and connectivity of Windows intact,\" says Microsoft\'s head of Windows Experience Julie Larson-Green. </p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 screenshots\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2817%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 screenshots\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2818%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>\"Although the new user interface is designed and optimized for touch, it works equally well with a mouse and keyboard.

And depending on whether partners have \"concerns\" about it, Microsoft might give the same tools to journalists, IT pros and users.</p><p>Windows 8 is also set to feature <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/windows-8-to-kill-off-adobe-reader--940626\">a native PDF reader</a>, meaning PC owners will no longer need to install a third-party app such as Adobe Reader to view PDFs. The new PDF reader is known as \'Modern Reader\', and uses the new AppX application package type, which is similar to that in Windows Phone 7 and likely to be used in Windows Phone 8 . </p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 screenshots\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2840%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Reports that surfaced on 18 April 2011, suggest that you\'ll be able to <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/windows-8-to-offer-portable-workspaces-on-usb-943852\">run Windows 8 from a USB stick</a>, using a feature called \'Portable Workspace\'. This feature is said to only be available in Windows 8 Enterprise Edition, though. </p><p>Microsoft has shown effortless movement between existing Windows programs and \"new Windows 8 apps.\" Yep, that\'s right - Microsoft is going right down the app route...</p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 screenshots\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2835%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>A Windows app store and Windows 8 apps<br /></strong></p><p>More than 30 app stores have launched in the last year and Microsoft isn\'t the only company copying Apple here; Intel has its own app store for Atom PCs. PC makers like the idea - apparently at the first forum they commented that it \"can\'t happen soon enough\".</p><p>With an app store, Microsoft hopes to attract more of the type of developers who are currently building smartphone apps and it wants them to create apps that make Windows the best place to use web apps (a job advert last October claimed \"we will blend the best of the web and the rich client by creating a new model for modern web applications to rock on Windows\".) </p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 screenshots\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%287%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Microsoft says the new OS will support \"web-connected and Web-powered apps built using HTML5 and JavaScript that have access to the full power of the PC.\"</p><p>There is \"effortless movement between existing Windows programs and new Windows 8 apps. The full capabilities of Windows continue to be available to you, including the Windows Explorer and Desktop, as does compatibility with all Windows 7 logo PCs, software and peripherals.\"</p><p>Windows 8 apps use HTML5, tapping into the native capabilities of Windows using standard JavaScript and HTML. New Windows 8 apps are full-screen and touch-optimized, and they easily integrate with the capabilities of the new Windows user interface. </p><p>\"There\'s much more to the platform, capabilities and tools than we showed today,\" says Larson-Green.</p><p>The Windows Store will be branded and optimised for each PC manufacturer. Your settings will follow you from PC to PC, as will your apps (although some slides refer to this as a possibility rather than a definite plan) - but you\'d need an HP ID to log into the \'HP Store powered by Windows\' and get your HP-specific apps. Microsoft doesn\'t plan to make money from the store; the early slides called it \"revenue neutral\".</p><p><img alt=\"More windows 8 rumours\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2844%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The full capabilities of Windows continue to be available to you, including the Windows Explorer and Desktop, as does compatibility with all Windows 7 logo PCs, software and peripherals.</p><p>\"Windows 8 apps can use a broad set of new libraries and controls, designed for fluid interaction and connectivity,\" says Larson-Green.</p><p>\"Apps can add new capabilities to Windows and to other apps, connecting with one another through the new interface. For example, we showed today how a developer can extend the file picker control to enable picking from their own app content or from within another Windows 8 app, in addition to the local file system and the network. We\'re just getting started.\"</p><p><strong>Windows 8 startup and shutdown</strong></p><p>The \'big three\' are boot time, shutdown time and battery life which will undergo massive improvement, but Microsoft is also thinking about how long it takes to get things done - how long until you read your first email, see the home page in your browser or start playing media. PCs should feel like an appliance that\'s ready to use as soon as you turn on the power. </p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 startup\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/images/Windows%208/speed%20up%20startup-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>FASTER STARTUP:</strong> <em>Windows 8 will show you what slows down startup and if removing an app you don\'t use improves it</em></p><p>Mobile PCs should resume \'instantly\' from sleep (in under a second from S3 sleep), and booting up will be faster because of caching, with a boot layout prefetcher and the ReadyBoost cache persisting even when you reboot. </p><p>As only 9 per cent of people currently use hibernate (which will work more quickly in Windows 8 because system information will be saved and compressed in parallel), Windows 8 will have a new Logoff and Hibernate combination that closes your apps like shutting the PC down does and refreshes your desktop like restarting does, but actually caches drivers, system services, devices and much of the core system the way hibernation does. </p><p>Turning the PC back on will take about half the time a cold boot needs (and the slides point out that on many PCs the power-on tests take longer than the Windows startup, so BIOS makers need to shape up). </p><p>It will be the default option but it won\'t be called Logoff and Hibernate; Microsoft is debating terms like Shutdown, Turn Off, Power Down and thinking through how the other options for turning the PC off will show up in the interface.</p><p>We\'ve previously reported on a whole load of other Windows 8 rumours, too:<strong><br /> </strong></p><p><strong>Windows 8 multimedia<br /></strong></p><p>Windows 8 will have better media playback and recording, but it will balance using hardware acceleration to save battery life and using the CPU when it gives a better result. </p><p><img alt=\"More windows 8 rumours\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2822%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Audio will use hardware acceleration more because that does improve battery life. There will be post-processing to take out blur, noise and shakey video filmed on a phone or webcam, and support for more codecs including AVC and as-yet-undetermined 3D video codecs (stereoscopic3D support is coming, for games and for 3D movies in Media Center, but there are format issues).</p><p>Microsoft talks about sharing \'with nearby devices\'; one way that will work is adding the Play To option currently in Windows Media Player to the browser for HTML 5 audio and video content, so you can play it on any device that supports DLNA, another is APIs to let other software do the same. </p><p><img alt=\"More windows 8 rumours\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011%20%2823%29-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>That will work with DRM content, if it\'s protected with DTCP-IP (digital transmission content protection over IP) or Microsoft\'s own PlayReady and hardware acceleration will speed up DRM decoding. </p><p>There\'s also a new \'remote display\' option that will let you send your screen from a laptop to a large monitor (which will use DirectX hardware acceleration and the same multimonitor interface that\'s already in Windows 7, but for wireless displays as well, which could be an Internet-connected TV - Microsoft refers to 35 per cent of TVs having network connectivity by 2012 and wonders whether to prioritise Internet TV over further improvements to broadcast TV).</p><p><strong>Windows 8 Help and Support</strong></p><p>In Windows XP the Help and Support centre was a branded hub of tools and links; in Windows 7 it\'s far more minimal. Windows 8 will go back to the branded experience, with integrated search for support forums run by your PC manufacturer but add the Windows 7 troubleshooters. </p><p>It will also link better with the Action Center, with tools that show more clearly what\'s happening on your PC; what apps are running, what resources are being used (like Task Manager showing which apps are using the most network bandwidth), how and when things have changed and what they can do about it. It will also include an Application Management tool that will let you find what apps are causing performance problems and adjust or remove them. </p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 task manager\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/images/Windows%208/why%20are%20we%20waiting-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>IMPROVED TASK MANAGER:</strong> <em>Task manager will make it easier to see why an app might not be performing; here the Zune software is using all the network bandwidth to download podcasts, so video in the browser keeps pausing. We hope the white on black isn\'t the final design!</em></p><p>The Windows pre-boot recovery environment will be simpler, combining the safe mode and \'last known good\' options into one interface. It will use what Microsoft calls \'superboot\' to remove malware and rootkits</p><p>If you have to reset your PC, Windows 8 will restore \"all the files settings and even the applications\" although you\'ll have to go to the Windows Store to download apps and get a list of apps that didn\'t come from the store, so it\'s not clear how automatic this will actually be.</p><p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> On 28 March 2011, the Windows 8 System Restore feature surfaced in a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/windows-8-screenshot-shows-system-restore-feature-938646\">screenshot</a>.</p><p>Microsoft is also apparently building a feature called <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/windows-8-to-include-time-machine-alike-history-vault-939621\">History Vault</a> into Windows 8. History Vault would allow users to back up files and data automatically using the Shadow Copies function and could also allow users to restore documents to a particular moment in time. </p><p><strong>Devices matter (almost) as much as PCs </strong></p><p>One of the reasons that Windows took off in the first place was working more easily with devices - in those days, printers. Support for a wide range of devices is one of the reasons it\'s hard to other OSes to challenge Windows but Microsoft would like to get hardware manufacturers to do more with the sensor platform and DeviceStage interface it introduced in Windows 7. </p><p>With Windows 8, Microsoft wants to see \"PCs use location and sensors to enhance a rich array of premium experiences. Users are not burdened with cumbersome tasks that Windows can accomplish on its own. Users are neither annoyed or disturbed by the actions the PC takes. Instead, the PC\'s behaviour becomes integrated into users\' routine workflows. Devices connect faster and work better on Windows 8 than on any other operating system.\"</p><p>The \'current thinking\' is for Windows 8 to include Microsoft\'s own Wi-Fi location service Orion (which has 50-100m accuracy in North America and Western Europe but falls back to using the location associated with IP addresses elsewhere, which can be as bad as 25km). </p><p>Orion will be used in Windows Phone 7 (as well as Hawaii, a Microsoft Research project to build cloud-enabled mobile apps which refers to Orion as a \'prototype service\'). Microsoft partnered with Navizon in March to use their Wi-Fi and mobile network location database but the slides claim that Orion is buying a bigger database than Navizon\'s 15 million access points, giving it 40 million compared to Google\'s 48 million (neither matches the 120 million Skyhook gives the iPhone). </p><p>Location will be available to the browser as well as to any app that\'s written to use it (music players as well as mapping tools), and web apps will get access to webcams. </p><p>Microsoft is emphasising the privacy aspect of location and webcam use, with mockups of how apps can ask for location and users can choose to deny it or only allow it once. And it\'s also asking PC manufacturers how many devices they plan to put GPS in and offering a Device Stage interface for using a PND like a Garmin nuvi as a GPS source for your PC. </p><p><img alt=\"Windows 8 location privacy\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/images/Windows%208/location%20privacy-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>LOCATION PRIVACY:</strong> <em>Web apps can see your location and use your webcam – but you get to control that to protect your privacy</em></p><p>As we\'ve said before, Device Stage will become the standard way you work with devices; Microsoft previewed the options you\'ll get with a featurephone and a webcam as well as GPS.</p><p>Along with GPS, Microsoft is expecting PCs to include infrared sensors as well as the ambient light sensors that are becoming common, and the accelerometers that are in tablets with rotating screens. </p><p>Put that together and the PC could know which way up it is, whether there\'s anyone in front of it - or near it and what the lighting is like in the room. So when you walk into the room your PC notices and wakes itself up so by the time you sit down the webcam is ready to recognise you - and no waiting or having to line your face up with a box on screen. </p><p>If this works, the camera will pick your face out of the room, like Photo Gallery finding a face in a picture (hopefully without thinking the face in a picture on the wall is you). When you walk away it goes back to sleep again. </p><p>We like the idea of rotation lock buttons on \'Lap PCs\' so you can move them around to control a game without flipping he screen repeatedly; again, if you look away from the game, Microsoft envisages it pausing automatically and if you pass a slate to someone it will switch to their account automatically.</p><p>What\'s in: USB 3, Bluetooth hands free and headset profiles (mono and stereo audio).</p><p>What\'s out: Microsoft has no plans to support Bluetooth 3.0 + High Speed, 1394 might be deprecated and Microsoft seems to expect USB 2 ports to be phased out in favour of USB 3 within the lifetime of Windows 8. </p><p>What\'s under consideration: Bluetooth Low Energy (from Bluetooth 4.0). What\'s not mentioned: Intel LightPeak, although Microsoft does ask if it\'s missing anything on its list of connectivity.</p><p><strong>Windows 8 Xbox Live integration</strong></p><p>Like Windows Phone 7, Microsoft is planning to add <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/windows-8-to-have-xbox-live-integration-964736\">Xbox Live to Windows 8</a>.

It\'s a fact. The result is that you don\'t see all the detail in onscreen images, and the colours aren\'t accurate. </p><p><p>Atone time this might only have been an issue for professional photographers, but today, when just about everyone stores, edits and views their photographs digitally, we all need a properly adjusted monitor. </p><p>It\'s not just a matter of onscreen viewing either - a poorly adjusted monitor can also result in disappointing hard copies.</p><p>Having a correctly adjusted monitor is important in areas other than digital photography, too. Even if you\'re just browsing the web or playing games, unless your monitor setup is correct, you could be missing out by not seeing images in the best possible light. </p><p><img alt=\"How to calibrate your monitor\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20309/PCP309.make5.monitorbody1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Monitor adjustment can be a very complicated and costly process if you use specialised hardware to do it, but it doesn\'t have to be that way. </p><p>Here we\'ll look at some of the simple, free ways of setting up your monitor. </p><p>Certainly a professional-level photographer or a very serious amateur might need more advanced tools, but even the simple methods we look at here are capable of making a vast difference to onscreen images.</p><p>Before proceeding, make sure your monitor has been turned on for at least 30 minutes so that it\'s had time to warm up, and restore its default settings using your graphic card\'s control program. This will probably force at least 24-bit colour, and in the case of an LCD monitor, will return the panel to its native resolution. If not, make sure to select these settings before continuing.</p><p><strong>Colour temperature</strong></p><p><img alt=\"How to calibrate your monitor\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20309/PCP309.make5.monitorbox3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The easiest, and perhaps most fundamental thing to adjust, is your monitor\'s colour temperature. Using the official jargon, the colour temperature of light is the temperature of what\'s known as an \'ideal black body radiator\', at which the colour of the light and the black body are identical. </p><p>Although an ideal black body radiator is a theoretical concept that doesn\'t actually exist in reality, it isn\'t too far removed from everyday experience. We\'re familiar, for example, with the fact that an object commonly glows red when it\'s heated to a sufficiently high temperature, and that if it\'s heated further it glows orange, then yellow and then white.</p><p>What might be less familiar is that at even higher temperatures, objects start to take on a bluish hue. If we restrict ourselves to the middle of this range, where we\'re talking about shades of white, the lower temperatures represent warm whites and the higher temperatures (paradoxically) correspond to cooler-looking whites. </p><p>For example, the colour temperature of a tungsten filament light bulb is about 2,500-2,900K (K stands for Kelvin, a unit of temperature that\'s the same as degrees Celsius, but offset such that 0K is equal to -273°C), while a halogen bulb is somewhat higher and an average sunlit scene is around 6,500K. </p><p>As shipped from the manufacturer, nearly all monitors are set up for a colour temperature of 9,300K. </p><p>This is the colour that pure white will appear, and while it might be a perfectly suitable setting applications such as word processing or engineering drawing applications, it\'s far too blue for photography, games or web browsing. </p><p>What you need is something closer to the colour of a daylight scene - around 6,500K. This is easily achieved using your monitor\'s setup menus, which are normally accessed using buttons on the front of the monitor (although details vary between manufacturers and models). </p><p>Select the menu entry for colour temperature and select 6,500K (sometimes shown as D65) instead of 9,300K (or D93). If you\'re used to using monitors set to 9,300K, this new setting will look decidedly dull by comparison, but persevere and your eyes will soon get used to the new and more accurate colours.</p><p><strong>Brightness/contrast</strong></p><p><img alt=\"How to calibrate your monitor\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20309/PCP309.make5.monitortestchart-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Just as most monitors are set to the wrong colour temperature for a large number of applications, it\'s common to find that the brightness and contrast aren\'t correctly adjusted either. </p><p>If the monitor is too dark, all shades of grey darker than a certain threshold will appear black, and if it\'s too bright then all shades of grey brighter than a certain threshold will appear white. The former means that you won\'t be able to see detail in dark areas of photographs such as shadows, while the latter means that detail in brightly lit areas will be lost.</p><p>Display a greyscale test chart on screen. You can make your own using a graphics package or choose one of the many charts available online. </p><p>If you\'re making your own chart, you need to make sure it has around 21 levels of grey from pure black to pure white, in steps of five per cent in brightness. </p><p><img alt=\"How to calibrate your monitor\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20309/PCP309.make5.monitorbody3-210-100.jpg\" width=\"210\" /></p><p>Ensure you\'re working in a room with subdued lighting, but not totally dark. The aim is to adjust the brightness and contrast on your monitor so that all the shades of grey can be distinguished from each other, using the lowest brightness setting that will achieve that. </p><p>This is very much a matter of trial and error, but as a starting point, try setting the contrast to 100 per cent for a CRT monitor or 40 per cent for an LCD monitor, and adjusting the brightness as necessary. </p><p>How easy this proves to be will depend on the quality of your monitor, and you may just find it\'s not achievable - in which case you\'ll have to accept a compromise.</p><p><strong>Gamma adjustment</strong></p><p><img alt=\"How to calibrate your monitor\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20309/PCP309.make5.monitorbody4main-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If the brightness and contrast have been set up correctly, then acolour defined by the software as0, 0, 0 will appear as pure black, while 255, 255, 255 will appear aspure white. </p><p>These examples assume 24-bit colour. In each case, the first figure in the brackets represents the amount of red in the range 0 to 255, the second figure is the amount of green, and the third the amount of blue. </p><p>You might assume, therefore, that a value of (127, 127, 127), for example, would appear as 50 per cent grey, but this isn\'t necessarily the case. This would only be true if something called the gamma value was equal to one, which means that the relationship between the input bits and the brightness is linear. </p><p>In reality, because the human eye doesn\'t have a linear response to light, this setting wouldn\'t result in the most accurate rendering of photographs. </p><p>If the gamma setting is too low, mid-level tones will appear too light; if the gamma setting is too high, they will appear too dark.</p><p>The recommended value for gamma is 2.2, so for optimum results you should adjust the settings of your graphics card until an image appears as expected at this value. </p><p>Test charts used for gamma adjustment feature two squares, one filled in solid at a known grey level, and the other composed of alternating black and white bands so that it appears the same shade of grey as the solid square at the correct gamma setting.</p><p>To adjust the gamma value, display a gamma test chart onscreen. </p><p>Some are created specifically for a given gamma setting, in which case you should choose one for a value of 2.2, whereas <a href=\"http://radsite.lbl.gov/radiance/refer/Notes/gamma.html\">others display a sliding scale</a> so by looking for the closest match you can read from the gamma value for which your system is configured. <a href=\"http://www.normankoren.com/makingfineprints1B.html#gamma_3lvl\">This chart</a> gives potentially better results by allowing you to carry out the adjustment while looking at three different shades of grey. </p><p>Look at the chart either from a distance or while squinting, so that the alternate black and white lines merge and you just see each square\'s average brightness. </p><p>Now adjust the graphics card\'s gamma setting until the grey square and the square with alternate black and white lines appear the same intensity for a gamma value of 2.2.The gamma is now set correctly. </p><p>Note that, confusingly, some graphics cards indicate that their default gamma setting is one. In such cases this isn\'t the actually gamma level, but a correction factor - the real default setting will probably be 2.2.</p><p><strong>Colour adjustment</strong></p><p><img alt=\"How to calibrate your monitor\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20309/PCP309.make5.monitorbody5-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>While the settings we\'ve seen so far are by far the most important ones when it comes to ensuring colours look accurate on your screen, there\'s a possibility that your monitor might also exhibit a colour cast, even after the colour temperature has been set to 6,500K. </p><p>To fully address this problem, you\'ll need to use a specialised hardware calibration device, but it may be possible to make an improvement using software tools alone.</p><p>In addition to adjusting the overall gamma value, many graphics cards make it possible to adjust the gamma value individually for each of the three primary colours - red, green and blue. </p><p>Since incorrectly set gamma values are a possible cause of inaccurate colours, this is something quick and easy to try before going to the expense of the hardware solution.</p><p>The process for this is much the same as for adjusting the overall gamma value, except for the fact that instead of using the monochrome gamma test chart, you\'ll need <a href=\"http://www.normankoren.com/makingfineprints1B.html#Gamma_3colour\">separate gamma test charts for each primary colour</a>. These are few and far between. </p><p>Bear in mind, though, that because it\'s such a dark colour, adjusting the gamma value for blue can be very difficult to do by eye, and it\'s possible that you could make things worse rather than better. </p><p>If this proves to be the case, you\'ll have to abandon the idea of adjusting the gamma value for each colour individually and return to adjusting the overall gamma setting instead. </p><p>-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a

/><p>Potentially hundreds of thousands of Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cables are to be recalled because HDMI Org has deemed the cable system to be out of HDMI spec, TechRadar has learned.</p><p>A source has contacted TechRadar to explain the situation and told us that putting a Mini-DP plug on the end of a cable with an HDMI plug is \'out of HDMI spec\', which effectively means that HDMI Org has banned all Mini-DP to HDMI cables on the market as of today.</p><p>The Mini DisplayPort is currently used on Apple\'s Mac line-up, and an adaptor or DisplayPort to HDMI cable is needed if you want to hook the computers up to a HD Ready display. </p><p><strong>Out of HDMI</strong></p><p>All companies who offer these cables have to go through HDMI Org if they want to use the HDMI name and branding, which costs money - those who don\'t are in breach of HDMI regulations.</p><p>According to our source, if all these cables have indeed been placed on the \'out of HDMI\' spec list, then they will have to be changed to suit the new requirements.</p><p>For them to pass, HDMI Org has reportedly requested that the Mini DP plug that currently adorns the cables has to be replaced with a socket for it to meet compliance regulations.</p><p>This does mean that any Mini DisplayPort to HDMI adaptor will not be affected by the HDMI\'s decision. </p><p>Considering this is said to cost in the region of $8,000 for each cable model to be approved, it could prove a rather expensive recall for the companies in question.</p><p>TechRadar has contacted HDMI Org to see if there is any truth to the situation and is also ringing around cable suppliers to see if they have been affected.</p><p>As most of these cables have been on the market for the last 18 months or so, it is still unclear whether this is a change in stance from HDMI Org or whether the cable system has taken this long to go through the HDMI compliance rigmarole.</p><p>Currently there are a number of companies still offering this cable system on the Apple website, <a href=\"http://store.apple.com/uk/product/H2774ZM/A/Mini-DisplayPort-to-HDMI-Cable-2m\">including iWires</a>.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

thinking that CDs and DVDs are outmoded technologies. With flash memory getting cheaper and the cloud becoming ever more pervasive, storing data on circles of plastic-coated aluminium seems little better than chiselling ones and noughts on slabs of stone. </p><p><p>But it\'s not that simple. How will the cloud help if your PC won\'t boot? Is a thumb drive any use if you want to play a movie in your vintage DVD player? </p><p>Like it or not, CDs and DVD still have their place in the world. They\'re cheap, easy to make and can often work as a brilliant bridging mechanism between different devices and data formats. </p><p>Here are 12 disc burning tips to help you squeeze more data onto a disc, burn audio discs and more.</p><p><strong>1. How to make a data disc </strong></p><p>Windows\' own data disc burning routines can be slow and frustrating, and don\'t always produce a disc that can be read by other devices. You\'re better off using a dedicated disc-burning program like <a href=\"http://cdburnerxp.se/\">CD BurnerXP</a> or <a href=\"http://www.imgburn.com/\">ImgBurn</a>. </p><p>These make burning data to disc simpler, and avoid the need to cache the whole disc contents to a temporary folder in the process. </p><p>If you\'re using CD BurnerXP, launch the program and choose \'Data disc\'. Browse to the files or folders you want to include and drag them onto the lower pane. Check the indicator to see how full your disc is. Click \'Burn\' to write your files to disc. </p><p>In ImgBurn, choose \'Write files/folders to disc\', then drag the files you want to burn into the left-hand pane. Click the \'Build\' button and the program checks your compilation, offering corrections to make the disc compatible with most devices. It can also verify the data on the disc after burning it. </p><p><strong>2. How to overburn a disc</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Overburn\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make_helpdesk.overburn-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Launch CD BurnerXP, insert the disc you want to write to, and add the files or folders you want to burn. If the data size exceeds that of the disc by only a small amount, click \'Burn\' and then choose \'Overburn\' when you\'re warned about the mismatch. </p><p>If the disc burns successfully, test it to see that all the files have been transferred. The smaller the overburn, the less likely you are to have problems. </p><p><strong>3. How to burn a secure disc</strong></p><p>The simplest way to encrypt files on a disc is to use <a href=\"http://www.truecrypt.org/\">TrueCrypt</a>. Select \'Create volume | Create a file container | Standard TrueCrypt volume\'. Choose \'Select file\' and browse to where you want to store the container file. Enter a filename and save it. Provide your password and opt to format the volume. </p><p>You can mount it using TrueCrypt with your password, and use it to store sensitive files. Once you\'ve added your files to this volume, burn the container file to disc using your disc-burning software. </p><p><strong>4. How to make a bootable DOS disc</strong></p><p>You might want to create a DOS boot disc if you have old games that only run under DOS. To do so, you need a PC with a floppy drive and a DOS boot disk, which you can download from <a href=\"http://www.bootdisk.com/\">www.bootdisk.com</a>. </p><p>Use ImgBurn and choose \'Mode | Build\'. Put your DOS boot floppy into the floppy disk drive. Choose \'Advanced | Bootable disc\' and select \'Make image bootable\'. </p><p>Choose \'Floppy Disc 1.44MB\' as the emulation type and select your floppy drive under \'Extract boot image\'. Add any other files you want to include. Insert your CD and click \'Burn\'. Boot from this disc and it acts like the A: drive. </p><p><strong>5. How to burn dual layer discs</strong></p><p>Burning data to a dual-layer disc works in much the same way as creating a data disc, as long as you use a disc-burning program that supports dual-layer burning, and have a dual-layer capable disc and drive. However, if you want to create a video disc, you\'ll need to decide where the layer break comes, because there will be a slight pause here during playback.</p><p>In ImgBurn, choose \'Build mode\' and add the DVD video files that you need for your project. Click the \'Burn\' button and provide a volume label. ImgBurn shows some suggestions for the layer break position. Select one and click \'OK\' to proceed. </p><p><strong>6. How to burn an audio CDs</strong></p><p>CDs that play in standard CD players need to be in Compact Disc Digital Audio format. Most music files are stored on a PC in compressed forms and need to be converted. Several programs are capable of doing this, including Windows Media Player, but CD BurnerXP provides a very simple interface. </p><p>Launch the program and choose \'Audio disc\'. Click \'OK\'. Browse to the audio files that you want to include in your disc and drag them into the lower pane in the order you want them to appear on the CD. Insert a CD and click \'Burn\' to produce the final disc. </p><p><strong>7. How to combine VOB files</strong></p><p>DVDs recorded on camcorders or home DVD recorders save their contents in VOB, IFO and BUP files. The files with the extension VOB that contain the video, while the other types include disc information and backups. </p><p>You can play VOB files in <a href=\"http://www.videolan.org/\">VLC media player</a>, but your files won\'t necessarily match up with chapters. </p><p>To get a full video, you may need to combine several VOB files. There\'s a simple program that will do this, called Join VOB Files Tool. <a href=\"http://beginwithsoftware.com/videoguides/joinvobfilestool.html\">Get it from here</a>, then unzip the file and launch the executable. </p><p>Click \'Add VOB file\' and browse to the files you want to join. Click \'Change file name\' and supply the name and location for the joined up file, then click \'Join VOB files\'. </p><p><strong>8. How to burn a Blu-ray disc </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Blu-ray\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make_helpdesk.bluray-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>To burn a Blu-ray disc, you\'ll need the disc itself and a drive capable of writing to it. ImgBurn supports Blu-ray recording. Launch it and choose Write Files/Folders to disc. For a data disc, add whatever files and folders you want to the \'Source\' box. </p><p>If you have a video Blu-ray disc authored, you should have a folder labelled \'BDAV\' or \'BDMV\', and one labelled \'CERTIFICATE\'. Browse for these and add them to your compilation. </p><p>Now select \'Options\' on the right-hand side, then \'Data Type MODE1/2048\'. For \'Filesystem\' choose \'UDF\', and for \'UDF revision\' select \'2.50\'. Tick the box marked \'Recursive subdirectories\'. </p><p>Now, on the \'Information\' tab, click \'Calculate\' to check you have enough space. Click \'Build\' and provide a volume label when prompted. </p><p><strong>9. How to create recovery files</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Recovery\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make_helpdesk.recovery-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Whenever you burn a data disc, you\'re likely to have some spare space. You could use this to store other files to ensure each disc is full up, or you could use it to better advantage by storing recovery files for the data that you\'ve already put on your disc. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.quickpar.org.uk/\">QuickPar</a> is a data verification and recovery tool that lets you create recovery files from the originals. If anything goes missing, you can use these recovery files and what\'s left of the data to reconstruct the missing bits. </p><p>Launch QuickPar and click \'Add files\'. Add all the files that you want included on your disc. Drag the \'Redundancy\' slider until the data size matches your spare space. Click \'Create\' to produce the PAR2 files. Once complete, return to your disc-burning program, add these PAR2 files and burn the disc. </p><p><strong>10. How to restore from PAR2 files</strong></p><p>Launch QuickPar and click \'Open\'. Browse to one of the PAR2 files alongside the data that you copied from your damaged disc.</p><p> The software will detect any missing or damaged files and show them as it scans the data. As long as not too much data has been damaged, QuickPar can recover what\'s been lost. Click \'Repair\' and wait for the program to restore the damaged files to their rightful place. </p><p><strong>11. How to read damaged discs</strong></p><p>If you find that a CD or DVD no longer reads properly and there are no visible fingerprints or scratches, you may be able to rescue some or most of the data using the free version of <a href=\"http://www.isobuster.com/\">ISO Buster</a>. </p><p>Insert your damaged disc and launch ISO Buster. Click \'Refresh\' if it isn\'t detected. You\'ll see each session of recording on the disc. Choose \'File\' and pick a session. Choose \'Extract session | Extract user data\'. Provide a location to save this to disc. You can then open the image and restore intact files. </p><p><strong>12. How to convert to ISO </strong></p><p><img alt=\"ISO recorder\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make_helpdesk.isorecord-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Install ISO Recorder, which is <a href=\"http://isorecorder.alexfeinman.com/W7.htm\">available from here</a>. Insert the disc you want to convert, right-click it in My Computer and choose \'Create image\'. </p><p>In the resulting dialog, ensure the right drive is selected and browse to the location where you want to save the image file. Provide a filename. Click \'Next\' and wait as the ISO image is generated. When it\'s complete, click \'Finish\'. You can now browse to your ISO disc image file.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/163c76de/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/14e003cc/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cstorage0Cseagate0Egoflex0Esatellite0Ewirelessly0Eboosts0Eipad0Estorage0E956140A0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Seagate GoFlex Satellite wirelessly boosts iPad storage</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/162ef27c/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cstorage0Chow0Essds0Ework0E9694730Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Explained: How SSDs work</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16e62556/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cstorage0Cge0Eunveils0E50A0Agb0Edisc0Ethat0Ecan0Ehold0E20A0Eblu0Erays0E9828430Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">GE unveils 500GB disc that can hold 20 Blu-rays</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Tutorial%3A+12+disc+burning+tips&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fstorage%2F12-disc-burning-tips-971730%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Tutorial%3A+12+disc+burning+tips&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fstorage%2F12-disc-burning-tips-971730%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106216021344/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/163c76de/kg/239/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106216021344/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/163c76de/kg/239/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~4/3gbM_NWWQ_k\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~3/3gbM_NWWQ_k/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing-components\n',12040,NULL,'2011-06-28 08:47:00'),(87,'Explained: How SSDs work','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20242/PCF242.w_group.supertest-200-200.jpg\" /><p>From reading the advertising copy, you could be forgiven for thinking that SSDs have no downsides. Much faster than traditional spinning hard drives, far more resilient to being dropped, ultra quiet, it seems the only negative anyone can point to is the price.</p><p> In reality, there are a couple of issues you should be aware of when using SSDs, and why the operating system you use is suddenly very important. </p><p>When you use a PC day in, day out, you get used to how the machine as a whole runs with your particular mix of applications. Some of these applications could be compute-bound - that is, the bottleneck in using the app is determined purely by how quickly the CPU is able to run. </p><p>A great example of this is converting video from one format to another - from DVD to MP4 to play on your iPod Touch, for example. No matter what you do, the speed of the conversion is entirely down to the CPU; the disk sub-systems are well able to cope reading and writing data. </p><p>Some applications are different - they\'re I/O-bound. Your perception of the application\'s speed is governed by how quickly the disk subsystems read and write. An example of this is an application you don\'t really think of as such: booting up your PC. </p><p>When you boot your PC, the boot manager has to load various disparate drivers and applications into memory from your boot disk and set them all running. Modern OSes use hundreds of these programs, drivers, and services and applications that try to help you speed up your boot times often just concentrate on minimising what gets loaded during the boot process as a whole. </p><p><strong>Disk delays </strong></p><p>Standard disk drives don\'t do brilliantly at I/O-bound applications. The reasons are essentially two-fold. </p><p>The first is that the head has to be positioned to the right track on the correct platter, ready for the correct sector to rotate round under the head. This is the seek time. Once positioned, the head has to wait for the right sector to appear (the rotational delay) so that it can read the data requested. </p><p>Another delay might be caused by the disk having to be spun up, because many systems - especially laptops running on batteries - stop the platters rotating after a period of no activity to conserve energy. </p><p>The first delay was significant in the early days of disk drives when it was in the order of half a second or so, but the seek time has been continually refined so that it\'s now around 10ms for standard desktop or mobile drives. </p><p>The second delay is directly proportional to the rotational speed of the platters. Over the years, the speed of drives has slowly increased, with standard mobile drives running at 5,400rpm and desktop drives at 7,200rpm - although high-end laptops (except, significantly, Apple\'s) tend to have 7,200rpm drives as standard these days. You can buy 10,000rpm drives for desktops, and some recommend using them for your boot drives. </p><p>For comparison, the drives found in iPod Classics are 4,200rpm drives (other current iPods just use Flash memory).</p><p> Another factor in the overall speed of disk drives is how quickly you can read data from the platter and get it into RAM. Here, coupled with the move to SATA interfaces from the older PATA interfaces, the rate is proportional to the density of data on the platter, with the density slowly but surely increasing annually. </p><p>Nevertheless, the speed of hard drive technology is bound by physics and mechanics. Yes, more data is being stuffed into smaller spaces, but the overall speed of the drive is still governed by the speed of the spinning platter.</p><p> In order to get more speed, manufacturers moved to different technology: flash memory. </p><p><strong>The birth of the SSD </strong></p><p>It had to happen at some point after flash memory became reliable and cheap enough: stuff as many flash memory chips as possible in a hard drive enclosure, add a controller and you remove the mechanical performance issues in one fell swoop. Enter the modern SSD.</p><p>The flash memory in an SSD is known as NAND-flash. There are two types: SLC (single-level cell) and MLC (multi-level cell).</p><p> In SLC, each cell of memory stores one bit, and in MLC, it usually stores two bits. MLC is generally cheaper to manufacture than SLC (each cell holds double the information, so the same number of cells will hold more data), and that\'s what we usually find in retail SSDs. </p><p>The value of the cell is obtained by testing the cell with some voltage. The SLC cell will respond to a certain voltage: at one level, the cell is assumed to hold 0; at another level the cell is assumed to hold 1. With MLC, the cell will respond to one of four different levels of voltage, which we can denote as 00, 01, 10, and 11. </p><p>Notice what this means: with MLC memory, to read a cell you have four times the number of tests to make, which takes longer. Nevertheless, we\'re talking orders of magnitude faster reads than the fastest disk drives can manage. </p><p>Except it\'s not that simple. The issue is that setting a cell to hold a value involves two different voltages too. There\'s the programming voltage, which essentially sets the cell to 0, and there\'s the higher erasure voltage, which sets the cell to 1. </p><p>The programming and erasure voltages are higher than the read test voltages because they need to force electrons to tunnel over an oxide substrate between two gates.</p><p><img alt=\"Idealised structure of a flash cell\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.theory.figure1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>FIGURE 1:</strong> <em>Idealised structure of a flash cell. The floating gate stores the charge denoting \'on\' or \'off \'</em></p><p> Imagine the following scenario, which illustrates how these gates work: you have two jars of water connected by a pipe. The pipe has a tap and one jar is lower than the other. Fill the top jar. When the top jar is full, the system is assumed to store a 1. If you now open the tap (this doesn\'t take much work at all), the water drains down to the bottom jar (in SLC terms, this is programming the system). The system is now assumed to store a 0. </p><p>Now consider what you must do to set the system back to 1: you have to force the water back uphill and close off the tap, which is a lot of work (this is erasing the system in SLC terms). </p><p>In essence, when talking about NAND cells, programming is easy and erasing is hard. </p><p>Not only that, forcing electrons back and forth over the substrate causes the material to deteriorate. Eventually it deteriorates so much that the electrons do pretty much what they want to and the cell breaks down, no longer able to store a definable state. </p><p>For an SLC cell that takes around 100,000 programming/erasure cycles, but then again it only has to store two states. For an MLC cell, which stores four possible states, the rate of breakdown is much faster at about 10,000 cycles. </p><p>In reality, cells aren\'t programmed or erased singly. They are programmed (and read) in pages of 4KB and erased in blocks of typically 128 pages (or 512KB). Doing it like this simplifies the circuitry and the controller immensely, and file systems typically read and write in 4KB blocks anyway. </p><p>Given that erasing is more destructive to a cell than programming it, this means that erasing is done less often than programming. However, there\'s a catch. If you think about it, this discrepancy between programming and erasing means that a page is only writable once. </p><p>Writing a page will set some of the bits in that page to 0, and the only way to get them back to 1 again is to erase them. So, before you can write to a page again, you have to erase the whole block containing the page. </p><p>Actually, to be more specific, you have to read all the active pages in the block (except the one you want to overwrite), erase the block, and then write all the active pages back, followed by the new version of the page you wanted to write in the first place.</p><p><img alt=\"Figure 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.theory.figure2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>FIGURE 2:</strong> <em>Diagram of how an SLC cell responds to increasing voltage. An MLC cell will have four peaks</em></p><p> As you can imagine, this read-erase-write process takes a long time compared to writing a page for the first time. In fact, it\'s comparable to writing to a traditional hard disk. </p><p><strong>Overwriting data </strong></p><p>So what happens when you want to overwrite a page with some new data? The answer is that the original page is marked as \'invalid\' and the new version of the page\'s data is written in another page entirely (making sure the links to the data\'s position are updated). Want to update that data again? Mark the old page as invalid, write the data to a new empty page. </p><p>If you like, a page has three states: empty (it\'s erased), used (it contains data) and invalid (it used to contain data, but that data is now out of date and can be discarded the next time the block containing the page is erased). </p><p>You might think this is a ridiculous way of using storage efficiently, but consider it from this angle: a block can only be erased 10,000 times before it can no longer be used. It turns out that the benefits of using NAND flash (fast, tough, silent) outweigh the problem of only having 10,000 shots at using some memory. </p><p>Consider it from the level of the whole disk drive. Many people never fill up their drive. There\'s always plenty of room on it. An SSD controller can take advantage of that fact by writing to every page on the SSD before taking the drastic step of erasing a block. </p><p>This, incidentally, is the reason for the observations in the early days that a brand new SSD was always faster than an SSD that had been used for a while: the new drive had plenty of empty pages, and so writes happened at full speed. After a while, every page on the drive had been used, so some writes went through the read-erase-write cycle and slowed the overall speed of the drive drastically. </p><p>However, there is another wrinkle to the whole SSD story. A drive controller doesn\'t know anything about a file system - that\'s the operating system\'s job. The OS thinks of the drive as a linear array of pages, with the page indexes known as LBAs (logical block addresses). It then builds a hierarchical file system over that array by having files as a sequence of pages (for example, LBA 17, followed by 42, then 167, then 23) and folders as special files that contain an array of \'file entries\', with each entry containing a file name and the starting LBA. </p><p>The SSD controller is in charge of maintaining the mapping between an LBA number and the actual page of flash memory in the SSD. It seems simple enough, except that when you delete a file, the OS just marks it as deleted in the file system. That\'s why file undelete tools work - the file hasn\'t been physically deleted, the data is still on the drive. It\'s fast because no data gets written to the SSD. </p><p>If the file had just one flash page, that page wouldn\'t be marked as invalid. As far as the SSD is concerned, the page is still being used. </p><p>At some later time the OS will reuse a page that it knows has deleted data and write to it. At that point the SSD will do its usual work and mark the page as invalid and use another empty page. </p><p>This is where TRIM comes in. Solid state drive manufacturers recognized the problems of deleted files and having deleted pages hanging around. They came up with an API, known as TRIM, that allowed the OS to tell the drive that a file had been deleted and that such and such LBAs are now invalid and can be reused. The drive could then, at the time of the file delete operation, mark all affected pages as invalid and then perform a read-erase-rewrite operation on the blocks concerned.</p><p> Maybe not every time, but only if the proportion of invalid pages in the block reached a certain critical threshold. This would mean that file deletions would take longer, but this extra work would help during file write operations, which is where the user would prefer the speed. </p><p>Currently Windows 7 supports TRIM, whereas Mac OS X only does for certain Apple-badged drives. </p><p><strong>Idle garbage collection </strong></p><p>Another option that some SSDs support is known as idle garbage collection. In essence, what happens is that during moments of little to no drive activity, the controller goes through the blocks on the SSD and performs the read-erase-rewrite cycle on sufficiently \'dirty\' ones (again, provided that the number of invalid pages in a block has reached some threshold value). </p><p>Since this happens during idle times, the SSD is, in essence, cleaning up the drive ready for those times that you really need lots of empty pages ready to use. It\'s believed that Apple MacBooks use this system in some form or other (apart from those that now support TRIM, of course). </p><p>As you\'ve seen, SSDs are as fascinating as they are fast. By all means, get an SSD, but we would recommend making sure you\'re using Windows 7 first.

That means there\'s potentially some untapped power in the 590. </p><p>Obviously the clock settings have been tamed for the sake of power and temperature. After all, there\'s only one fan lying between the two chips, and it\'d be an awful shame to overheat the card and damage so much expensive circuitry. </p><p><strong>Why risk it? </strong></p><p>Well, firstly it\'s a lot safer to mess around with clock settings since Nvidia implemented a core voltage limit in their latest v267.91 driver release. The default 0.938V is now locked down. </p><p>Okay, that\'s slightly less headroom for overclocking, but voltage is unwise to mess with unless you\'re really sure what you\'re doing. There are already fables of people exploiting the previously unlocked voltage control and blowing up their 590s. Remember to update your drivers before you start tweaking, eh? </p><p>The biggest motivation for this overclock though, is simply to push graphics card performance to the limit. The GTX 590 is currently not only the fastest but also most expensive graphics card out there. Anyone who owns one does so to own the best of the best. So what if the best can get a bit better? </p><p><strong>Number crunching </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Heaven\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.overclocking.eugine02-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The best thing about overclocking your graphics card is that you can do it all in Windows - being able to push the numbers up and check stability without constantly restarting and going back into the BIOS saves a lot of time. </p><p>Using MSI Afterburner allows you to not only alter shader/core and memory clocks and fan speeds, but also monitor temperature too. The reference GPU core clock is 607MHz on a GTX 590, and 772MHz on the 580, and the processor clocks match up 1,215MHz to 1,544MHz. </p><p>There\'s also a 300MHz down-clocking of the memory clock as well. Those huge gaps makes it tempting to ramp up the clocks by large imcrements immediately (using the logic that it\'s the same GF110 chip) but it\'s quite simply impossible to match the 580\'s spec. </p><p>Don\'t see that as the final objective. Instead, bump up one individual core in 10MHz increments, leaving the cores you\'re not overclocking at stock levels. </p><p>That said, Afterburner allows the core and shader clock adjustments to be synced, which is recommended as manipulating these cores independently can lead to unnecessary instability rather than heat or voltage holding you back, these cores simply don\'t operate properly when one\'s hugely overclocked and the other isn\'t. </p><p><strong>Slow and stable <br /></strong></p><p><img alt=\"Rig\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.overclocking.rig01-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Moving up in such minute amounts sounds slow and painful, but you\'ll soon see if your system\'s stable by running a benchmark like Unigine\'s Heaven. If it crashes, your system\'s not stable… </p><p>The reference fan attached to that GTX 590 is mild-mannered at low speeds, but at 100 per cent it\'s a hair dryer from hell. In order to get the biggest overclock, it will need to be running at full speed. We wait with baited breath for some aftermarket coolers with a fan for each GF110 chip, but until that day, it\'s just the noisy old reference fan chugging away. </p><p>Once you\'ve found the tipping point for each core, it\'s time to overclock multiple cores. It really helps to run a benchmark that gives you minimum, maximum and average frames per second as this will show which cores are boosting performance the most, and as such which are worth trying together. </p><p>Again, don\'t expect miracles, log every benchmark result and crash. </p><p><strong>Hitting the heights</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Afterburner\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.overclocking.afterburner-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Overclocking results will never translate directly from one machine to another, particularly with different PSUs: there are too many variables. However, we managed to get the core clock running at a stable 687MHz with no other cores overclocked, and again the individually overclocked memory core running at 1957MHz without any tantrums. </p><p>When both GPUs are overclocked together, core and memory clocks run stably at 657MHz and 1,857MHz respectively. And, give or take a few megahertz here and there, most systems with a decent PSU should be able to handle similar settings. </p><p>That\'s a respectable step-up in raw numbers and adds a few extra frames to the games it already blitzes. But then, it was never about improving gaming performance, was it? </p><p>The GTX 590 is a graphics card for reaching extremes, and those extremes are that little bit more satisfying for having reached them yourself.</p><p><strong>Technical analysis </strong></p><p>The final stable core and memory clock settings offer yet more surplus frames to the most demanding graphical tasks out there.</p><p> It\'s worth noting factory overclocked versions of the GTX 590 will enter the market sporting clock settings that can be approximated, if not matched, by some simple software tweaking with the reference card. </p><p><img alt=\"Tech labs\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Benchmark%20graphics/thinbanner-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>DirectX 11 performance</strong></p><p><strong>Heaven 2.5: Frames per second: Higher is better </strong></p><p>Stock: 59.4<br />Overclocked: 63.9</p><p><strong>DirectX 11 gaming performance </strong></p><p><strong>Just Cause 2: Frames per second: Higher is better </strong></p><p>Stock: 66.39<br />Overclocked: 67.18</p><p><strong>AvP: Frames per second: Higher is better </strong></p><p>Stock: 80<br />Overclocked: 85</p><p><strong>Load temperature performance</strong> </p><p><strong>Load: Degree Celsius: Lower is better </strong></p><p>Stock: 79<br />Overclocked: 85</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/162bb548/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/14da0f96/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cgraphics0Ecards0Chow0Eto0Eupgrade0Eyour0Egraphics0Ecard0Ecooling0E9544970Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to upgrade your graphics card cooling</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15fc4c73/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cgraphics0Ecards0Cgraphics0Ecards0Ecompared0E10A0Erated0E9618260Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Graphics cards compared: 10 rated</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/169856f7/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cgraphics0Ecards0Camd0Eradeon0Ehd0E6990Am0Eworld0Es0Efastest0Emobile0Egpu0Eunveiled0E9780A380Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">AMD Radeon HD 6990M - world\'s fastest mobile GPU unveiled</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Tutorial%3A+How+to+overclock+the+GTX+590&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fgraphics-cards%2Fhow-to-overclock-the-gtx-590-969381%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Tutorial%3A+How+to+overclock+the+GTX+590&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fgraphics-cards%2Fhow-to-overclock-the-gtx-590-969381%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106215799090/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/162bb548/kg/221-239/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106215799090/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/162bb548/kg/221-239/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~4/1-Oc0MHx4tY\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~3/1-Oc0MHx4tY/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing-components\n',9287,NULL,'2011-06-25 09:00:00'),(89,'Apple reveals 3TB Time Capsule','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/images/TimeCapsule3TB-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Apple has snuck a new 3TB Time Capsule back-up device on to its online US website. </p><p>Although the new Time Capsule isn\'t available to buy yet, it seems that the 1TB model is being retired and replaced with the larger 3TB version, while the 2TB version remains. </p><p>No word yet on how much the big fat storage unit will set you back;

While 5.1 systems can offer unrivalled immersion through full surround sound, there are a number of factors that are causing them to fall out of favour. </p><p>For a start you need a lot of room to house the speakers. You also need to rearrange your room so that the speakers are properly positioned and calibrated, as well as laying the wires. These considerations can make 5.1 systems impractical for a lot of people, whereas 2.1 systems are much easier to get right, deliver just as good sound quality and through virtual surround sound technology can offer DTS and Dolby Digital surround sound effects. </p><p>High quality 5.1 systems can also cost a lot of money. Most budget 5.1 systems are a false economy because you end up buying speakers that are just not up to the task. Too many corners are cut and you\'d be much better off putting the money to a higher-end 2.1 set which will give you far better sound quality for a similar price. </p><p>There are a number of things you should expect from a decent set of 2.1 speakers. First and foremost is audio quality – the whole reason why you are upgrading. Any speaker set you go for should be made from components that offer the best possible audio quality. Deep bass sounds should be adequately provided by the sub-woofer – though not at the expense of other levels.</p><p> Because you can\'t always listen to speakers in action before you make your mind up and buy, we\'ve tested some of the best 2.1 speakers on the market to help you make a decision. </p><p><strong>1. Antec Soundscience Rockus 3D 2.1 - £150 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Antec\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_roundup.soundscience-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>An assured entry into the 2.1 PC speaker market. The build quality is excellent and makes the satellite speakers feel durable. The bodies house a 2.5 inch driver and the satellites are capable of 25W of power, while the medium sized subwoofer can handle 100W.</p><p> For music the sound definition is sharp and clear. Details are well-produced as are highs and mid ranges, with a bias towards the higher ends that can lead to a slightly harsh sound in some cases. </p><p>The bass is controlled by switching between three options. Annoyingly the switch is positioned at the back of the subwoofer, which makes it difficult to get to.</p><p> \'3D\' mode is specifically for games and movies and switching to it gives an instant boost to bass that gives a more cinematic – though not entirely 3D – experience. With a bit of tweaking you can get the 3D 2.1 to sound fantastic across any media or games. </p><p><strong>2. Corsair SP2200 - £76 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Corsair\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_roundup.speakers1b-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>At first glance these might seem unassuming, but once they\'re plugged in, such impressions are quickly forgotten. </p><p>High frequencies are reproduced fantastically, and mid ranges are crisp and clear. Subtle environmental effects in games and little flourishes in music, which can easily be missed by lower quality speakers, are given new life.</p><p> Bass sounds are well catered for by the throaty and powerful subwoofer that delivers power and impact to explosions in games and movies. </p><p>The sound positioning from the stereo speakers is also incredibly impressive, with sounds coming not only from the left and right, but also convincingly from the centre. Overall this is a fantastic 2.1 set and it won\'t cost you a fortune. </p><p><strong>3. Creative Zii Sound T6 - £249 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Creative\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_roundup.speakers2_1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you\'ve got a gaming laptop then the Creative Zii Sound T6 will definitely be up your street. These wireless speakers offer fantastic 2.1 sound without the hassle of cabling. </p><p>For desktop users this means a few less wires pouring out of your rig and adding to the already nightmarish tangle behind your desk. If you\'re a laptop gamer then the ability to sit with your laptop wherever you want without worrying about wires is a huge selling point. </p><p>From the early days of Sound Blaster, Creative has been a brand synonymous with PC sound technology and there is some good technology powering this set of speakers. </p><p>The speakers are made from two separate cabinets, so each speaker is actually made up of high end drivers. These can be swivelled and adjusted on the stands enabling you to adjust sound coverage in a room, resulting in better sound quality. And if the unit is connected to a PC via USB it can be used as a 5.1 system. </p><p>Highs and mid-range sounds are rich and vibrant, however bass sounds can end up sounding limp and lifeless, which is a shame. It\'s also pretty expensive so if you\'re not interested in its wireless capabilities your money should be spent on a better sounding system. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/speakers-and-headphones/speakers/creative-ziisound-t6-939710/review\">Read the full Creative Zii Sound T6 review</a></p><p><strong>4. Logitech Z623 - £111 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Logitech\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_roundup.speakers2_2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Not every speaker system is certified, and Logitech is proud of the Z623 2.1\'s certification. Unfortunately over the years the value of THX certification has been lowered by it being awarded to sub-par speakers. </p><p>The 200W amplifier built into the subwoofer delivers 35W to each of the speakers and a hefty 130W to the subwoofer for bass. The size of the subwoofer, and the amount of power delivered to it, is indicative of Logitech\'s aims here. </p><p>This is a speaker set designed for bombast. Because of this these speakers perform well in games and action films with scenes of carnage accompanied by a thunderous bass and reliable low ranges. </p><p>However when it comes to nuances, especially in music, the Logitech Z623 underperforms resulting in a rather cold sound reproduction. </p><p>The enjoyment gleaned from the Z623 relies heavily on what you want to use them for. For blasting out sounds from games and movies these perform fine. If you want to use them for listening to a lot of music, however, you\'re better off with a more versatile set of speakers. </p><p><strong>5. Sony SRS DB500 - £120 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Sony\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_roundup.sony-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Like the bouncer outside a rough club, the SRS DB500 is a big, ugly bugger that packs a hell of a punch. These are speakers that are meant to be placed alongside a gaming rig. </p><p>The subwoofer is capable of 150W RMS, and is flanked by two satellites that offer 75W apiece. This means they\'re capable of blasting out sounds that can give you an incredibly immersive experience. Where these speakers really come into their own is loud, intense action scenes. The mighty subwoofer brings raw power to explosions. </p><p>When it comes to music, things are not as clear cut. Where the bass adds extra depth to movies and games, with a lot of music it can be intrusive, drowning out a lot of the other ranges. Music also suffers from a muddy fidelity which means that some details are lost. You\'ll find yourself adjusting the settings on the fly as you switch between movies, games and music – and even between genres. </p><p>It might not be the end of the world, and when the SRS-DB500s shine, they really shine. However, their weaknesses highlight the fact that these are not the all-round performers we were expecting. </p><p> <strong>6. Teufel Concept D500 THX - £449 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Teufel\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_roundup.teufeul-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Not many companies can get away with charging so much for a 2.1 system, but Teufel is a respected brand when it comes to speakers. The build quality and design of these speakers is fantastic. They look amazing and feel sturdy – which is important considering the price, and the size.</p><p> As you could guess from the pricetag these are not ordinary PC speakers. Setting them up isn\'t a simple process and involves wiring the satellites to the subwoofer, rather than simply plugging them in. However when it\'s all set up and playing music all of a sudden the price, the inconvenience, everything makes sense.</p><p> These speakers sound phenomenal. The range these speakers can hit – from lows to highs – is impeccable and can transform music so much that your favourite tracks sound as fresh as when you first heard them. </p><p>The subwoofer performs incredibly well during movies and games, giving a strong bass presence without drowning out the rest of the sounds. They\'re a big investment but if you have the money you won\'t be disappointed. </p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/1600bba8/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15a2f311/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Chands0Eon0Easus0Erog0Evulcan0Eanc0Ereview0E9615730Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Hands on: Asus RoG Vulcan ANC review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15ffb3e2/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0Eall0Ein0Eone0Eprinter0E80Ereviewed0Eand0Erated0E9656650Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best all in one printer: 8 reviewed and rated</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16d11ef8/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0Emac0Ewebcam0Efor0Emac0E50Etested0E9684270Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best Mac webcam for Mac: 5 tested</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16ddb823/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0Ebluetooth0Eipad0Ekeyboard0E50Ereviewed0E980A6960Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best Bluetooth iPad keyboard: 5 reviewed</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Best+2.1+speaker+systems%3A+6+sets+tested&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fperipherals%2Fbest-2-1-speaker-systems-6-sets-tested-965804%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Best+2.1+speaker+systems%3A+6+sets+tested&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fperipherals%2Fbest-2-1-speaker-systems-6-sets-tested-965804%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/104472456117/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/1600bba8/kg/201/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/104472456117/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/1600bba8/kg/201/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~4/i2-AbjdPHV4\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~3/i2-AbjdPHV4/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing-components\n',12116,NULL,'2011-06-19 11:00:00'),(92,'Buying Guide: Best all in one printer: 8 reviewed and rated','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.otfeat.canon-200-200.jpg\" /><p>All-in-one printers are an attractive prospect. </p><p>Not only can you print with them, you can also scan, photocopy, fax and email documents without the need for separate machines, saving you space as well as money. </p><p><p>They can be awkward devices though, with the façade of a home office utopia often crumbling to reveal a disappointing reality of sub par print and scanning quality – as well as other evidence of too many features spread too thin. </p><p>This is especially true at the lower end of the market. You could easily get an all-in-one printer for around £60, but corners may have been cut in too many areas to make this purchase worthwhile. If you spend a bit more on a mid-range all-in-one, around the £100-£150 price range, you\'ll notice remarkable improvements across the board. </p><p>If you want an all-in-one printer that excels in all areas, then the initial extra expenditure can prove to be a wise investment. It\'s a delicate balancing act, though – spend too much and you may be paying for features that you don\'t need.</p><p><strong>1. Lexmark Genesis S815 - £379 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Lexmark genesis s815\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.otfeat.lexmark_gen-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>According to Lexmark, the Genesis S815 is \'the world\'s first now-in-one printer\'. But what exactly does that mean?</p><p> What\'s immediately clear is that Lexmark has tried to make the Genesis a stylish and attractive device. However, while the Genesis certainly looks striking, you can\'t help but feel that some of the features have been compromised by Lexmark\'s quest for aesthetic excellence. </p><p>For example, the scanner, usually found on the top of all-in-ones, is located on the front of the Genesis. When the scanner is on top, the lid can then rest on top of what you\'re scanning. </p><p>However, with this front-mounted scanner, scanning in anything thicker than a magazine can prove problematic because the lid refuses to remain shut. You can always stand there holding the lid shut yourself, but it\'s hardly an elegant solution. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/multi-function-mfd-/lexmark-genesis-s815-934264/review\">Read the full Lexmark Genesis S815 review</a></p><p><strong>2.

It\'s also one of the noisiest printer\'s on test, with mechanical whirrs and thunks that constantly remind you that it\'s switched on and busy doing something. These are only minor quibbles, however, as long as the print and image quality of the device are up to scratch. </p><p>Things didn\'t get off to a great start when the printer kept reporting a paper jam when calibrating itself. After numerous attempts, we removed the stack of paper from the tray and replaced it with a single, carefully positioned sheet. It then worked, but having to spoon-feed the printer wasn\'t an enticing prospect. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/multi-function-mfd-/kodak-esp-7250-913924/review\">Read the full Kodak ESP 7250 review</a></p><p><strong>3.

The HP Photosmart Plus adds web apps to this list. While almost every all-in-one can connect to your home network, this one supports third-party apps, giving you even more options for what to do with your photos. </p><p>For example, the Snapfish icon lets you upload photos you\'ve scanned to the Snapfish website, where you can edit and share them. You can also use Snapfish to transform photos into canvases, photo books, calendars and more. </p><p>Other apps let you find and print articles from the internet without turning on your PC, and print out calendars, notepaper and even games. A press of the touchscreen gives you a sheet of Sudoku puzzles, for example.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/multi-function-mfd-/hp-photosmart-plus-b210a-947725/review\">Read the full HP Photosmart Plus B210a review</a></p><p><strong>4.

It also has a colour LCD screen on the front, but none of the step-by-step guides provided by HP or Kodak. </p><p>As the name implies, this is an all-in-one that focuses on the job at hand. There\'s no button for printing Sudoku puzzles here. This aversion to bells and whistles is admirable only if the resulting device is of a high quality. Thankfully, when it comes to prints, the results are just that. The colour and detail outperform many more expensive printers. Full A4 photo printouts not only look very good, but are printed quietly and quickly.</p><p> Increasing the print quality reduces the output speed dramatically, but the increase in detail can make it worthwhile.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/multi-function-mfd-/epson-stylus-office-bx625fwd-947745/review\">Read the full Epson Stylus Office BX625FWD review</a></p><p><strong>5.

For some of us, as long as the all-in-one does the job competently, that\'s enough.</p><p>The Advent AWP10 is built around Kodak Colour Technology – so much so that when we accessed the disc to install the printer driver, it said that it was Kodak AiO Printer software. Nevertheless, the printer installed without a problem and in our first test of printing out a full A4 photograph on normal paper, the print quality surpassed that of the Kodak ESP 7250 AiO. </p><p>While colour reproduction and detail weren\'t perfect, the image was sharper and more vibrant that that produced by a printer costing almost twice as much. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/multi-function-mfd-/advent-awp10-909974/review\">Read the full Advent AWP10 review</a></p><p><strong>6.

This is because it\'s the only all-in-one in this test that\'s capable of handling A3 documents. </p><p>This additional feature – and the resulting size of the printer – can have two effects. You\'ll either be over the moon at being able to create poster-sized prints, or horrified at the amount of space the device takes up. </p><p>There\'s a rather bewildering array of buttons on the front of the machine, and many of the settings in the accompanying software require the PC to be rebooted to take effect. However, it offers a wide array of features, and its no-nonsense approach and solid performance are hallmarks of great value. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/multi-function-mfd-/brother-mfc-j6510dw-936460/review\">Read the full Brother MFCJ6510DW review</a></p><p><strong>7.

Thankfully, it does photos justice with excellent colour reproduction, especially when printing on photo paper. </p><p>Photocopying is also fast, quiet and accurate. A photocopy of hand-written notes was practically indistinguishable from the original; as with the Brother MFC-J6510DW, subtle details were picked up perfectly. Even with more complicated documents, the Pixma MG5250\'s copying function produced very good results, proving equally adept with documents and photos. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/multi-function-mfd-/canon-pixma-mg5250-947757/review\">Read the full Canon Pixma MG5250 review</a></p><p><strong>8.

While it looks more like a traditional all-in-one printer, it costs a fraction of the Genesis S815\'s price. </p><p>The Interpret S405\'s no-nonsense approach it is refreshing. Unlike the colour LCD screens of the other all-in-ones, the Interpret has a small monochrome screen - a cost-cutting decision that means it can afford the fax capability that\'s so unusual in all-in-ones at this price. If you\'re looking for a cheap fax machine that can also photocopy, scan and print, this is a good choice. </p><p>Print quality isn\'t suitable for photo printing, although simple images and text are fine. When printing the test photo, colours were muted and the detail was far from a level we would be happy with. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/lexmark-interpret-s405-716906/review\">Read the full Lexmark Interpret S405 review</a></p><p><strong>Our verdict<br /></strong></p><p>We looked at devices at a wide range of price points in this test, and the results weren\'t as clear-cut as we first expected. Spending a lot of money doesn\'t necessarily get you the best all-in-one printer, as the Lexmark Genesis S815 proved with a hefty price tag but lightweight quality. </p><p>Some of the best results came from the lower priced models, which goes to show that cheaper models shouldn\'t be dismissed out of hand. </p><p>Another important fact that was brought to light in this test is that although most all-in-ones offer similar features, the results can vary dramatically. Knowing what you want to use the device for can help you make the right purchase and avoid buying a printer that will leave you dissapointed. </p><p>The Canon Pixma MG5250 all-in-one is aimed at people who want the best possible prints of their digital photos. The print quality was easily the best out of the all-in-ones we tested here, and the scanning and photocopying features were very impressive. It doesn\'t have fax though, so if you\'re after a more home office focused all-in-one, you\'ll need to bear this in mind. </p><p>The winner of our value award is the Epson Stylus Office BX625FWD might not be the cheapest all-in-one on test, but it offers the best set of features for its relatively low price. If you work from home and want an all-in-one that scan, email, fax and copy documents, this is an excellent choice. For a little over £100, you won\'t be disappointed with what it can do.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15ffb3e2/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15a2f311/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Chands0Eon0Easus0Erog0Evulcan0Eanc0Ereview0E9615730Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Hands on: Asus RoG Vulcan ANC review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/1600bba8/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0E20E10Espeaker0Esystems0E60Esets0Etested0E96580A40Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best 2.1 speaker systems: 6 sets tested</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16d11ef8/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0Emac0Ewebcam0Efor0Emac0E50Etested0E9684270Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best Mac webcam for Mac: 5 tested</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16ddb823/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cperipherals0Cbest0Ebluetooth0Eipad0Ekeyboard0E50Ereviewed0E980A6960Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best Bluetooth iPad keyboard: 5 reviewed</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Best+all+in+one+printer%3A+8+reviewed+and+rated&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fperipherals%2Fbest-all-in-one-printer-8-reviewed-and-rated-965665%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Best+all+in+one+printer%3A+8+reviewed+and+rated&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fperipherals%2Fbest-all-in-one-printer-8-reviewed-and-rated-965665%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/104472439939/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/15ffb3e2/kg/201-221-247/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/104472439939/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/15ffb3e2/kg/201-221-247/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~4/4-ucBu7YLqk\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~3/4-ucBu7YLqk/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing-components\n',14562,NULL,'2011-06-19 09:00:00'),(93,'Tutorial: How to fix Mac hardware problems','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20234/MAC234.main_feat.remote_1-200-200.jpg\" /><p>If you\'ve got problems connecting hardware to OS X, you\'re in the right place. </p><p>Here\'s our guide to the most common Mac hardware issues you might encounter - the biggest questions and, hopefully, some useful answers. </p><p><p><strong>\"My Mac won\'t recognise new external hardware\" </strong></p><p>Assuming your Mac meets the system requirements for whatever kit it is, have you checked all the wiring\'s okay? You might want to try hooking it up with a different lead and (where possible) port on your Mac. </p><p>Will the device work with another Mac? Are the lights on the device coming on? If not, there may be some problem with the hardware or its power adapter. </p><p>If you\'re sure that all the wiring is okay, you might want to check that you installed the driver software? Even if something says it\'ll work without drivers, it\'s often best to install them anyway. Furthermore, the version that you got in the box may be an old one, so go to the manufacturer\'s website and see if there\'s an update available. </p><p>Old drivers can also conflict with new, so see if you can find an uninstaller for the old version before you install the new. This is particularly important if the software that comes in the box is for an older version of OS X than you\'re running. And it may seem obvious, but have you tried restarting?</p><p> <strong>\"My PC won\'t read my USB stick or external drive\" </strong></p><p><img alt=\"external drive\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20234/MAC234.main_feat.western-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>That\'s probably because it\'s formatted for the Mac, and therefore Windows won\'t be able to read this. To be able to plug the stick into a PC, it will need to be FAT or NTFS formatted. The former is preferable, because your Mac can\'t write to NTFS disks without special software (such as $20 NTFS for Mac, on the cover disc). </p><p>To format a drive as FAT, open Disk Utility in Applications/Utilities/ select the drive on the left, click Erase and select MS-DOS (FAT) from the top drop-down. Remember that formatting a drive will wipe everything on it, so back things up first! </p><p>When it\'s done, you\'ll see the Format information at the bottom has changed to FAT16 (for drives under 512MB) or FAT32 (anything over 512MB). </p><p><strong>\"My Apple TV remote interferes with my Mac\" </strong></p><p>This is really annoying, isn\'t it! You can pair up an Apple Remote with your Mac or Apple TV by holding it close to the sensor and pressing Menu and Right/Fast Forward for at least six seconds until you see two linked loops appear on the screen. This will stop that device listening to other remotes, but the remote in question will still control other kit. </p><p>The way to prevent this is either to pair each device with an individual remote, or to disable the infrared sensor on your Mac, which you do in System Preferences > Security >General. You can\'t disable the infrared sensor on an Apple TV or Universal Dock. </p><p>To unpair a remote, incidentally, hold down Menu and Left/Rewind for at least six seconds while holding any remote close to an enabled infrared sensor. </p><p><strong>How to solve DVD drive issues </strong></p><p>You may hear the disc spinning fast, then slowing down again, but never appearing on your desktop. The fact it won\'t read any discs suggests the lens has got a bit grubby (as opposed to an individual CD being damaged), so you\'ll need to get yourself a lens cleaning CD. These are available from most electronics shops and will only cost you a few pounds. </p><p><strong>CD stuck in the drive! </strong></p><p>And the eject button on the keyboard won\'t do anything either, even if you hold it down for several seconds? In that case, restart your Mac while holding down the mouse or trackpad button. This\'ll force your machine to spit out the disc. </p><p><strong>Can I use mini CDs? </strong></p><p>No! Small or specially shaped CDs may look cute, but don\'t try putting one in your Mac\'s slot-loading optical drive. If you need to access what\'s on it, find someone who has a tray-loading drive and get at what you need that way. </p><p><strong>Quick tip</strong></p><p>If you connect a second screen or projector to your Mac, it assumes you want to extend your workspace onto it rather than replicating what the main display is showing. To change this, switch on Mirroring in System Preferences > Displays > Arrangement.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15ff0320/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/160ef70b/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Capple0Ereveals0E3tb0Etime0Ecapsule0E9689650Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Apple reveals 3TB Time Capsule</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/1658b029/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Crumour0Emini0Edisplayport0Eto0Ehdmi0Ecables0Elose0Ehdmi0Espec0E97370A0A0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Exclusive: Rumour: Mini DisplayPort to HDMI cables lose HDMI spec</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/16e833ed/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Chow0Eto0Einstall0Emac0Ememory0E9657560Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to install Mac memory</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Tutorial%3A+How+to+fix+Mac+hardware+problems&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fapple%2Fhow-to-fix-mac-hardware-problems-965748%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Tutorial%3A+How+to+fix+Mac+hardware+problems&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fapple%2Fhow-to-fix-mac-hardware-problems-965748%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/104472336839/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/15ff0320/kg/239/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/104472336839/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/15ff0320/kg/239/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~4/MvAScfNdY5I\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~3/MvAScfNdY5I/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing-components\n',6670,NULL,'2011-06-19 07:00:00'),(94,'Buying Guide: Graphics cards compared: 10 rated','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_group.radeon_hd6850b-200-200.jpg\" /><p>There\'s one component in your machine that will be superseded by faster and more powerful versions quicker than any other, and that\'s the graphics processor. </p><p>The graphics card is the supermodel part of any modern gaming PC. It, more than anything else, makes your games look beautiful and run as smoothly as a baby\'s velvet smoking jacket. </p><p>So, if you\'re a gamer and you\'ve got a bit of cash to spend - it\'s time you looked at some graphics cards compared and rated. </p><p>After all, forking out the lot on a new graphics card is the best way to up the frame rate of your favourite games and make the girls think you\'re attractive, right? </p><p>Unfortunately, that\'s not necessarily the way the graphics game works. The top-performing rigs are always the most well balanced. Put a Ferrari engine into a Mk1 Golf GTi and it will go fast, sure, but you\'ll fly off the first corner you come to and probably make someone an orphan. </p><p>To a certain extent, it\'s the same with a PC. Obviously it\'s not going to career off the desk and decapitate a passer-by, but using the fastest graphics card in the world for your rig isn\'t always going to make it the best machine. </p><p>There are a number of key considerations to think of before spending an obscene amount of cash on a GPU, or a pair of GPUs. Number one is, naturally, can you afford it? But we\'ll skip the personal economics lesson for now. </p><p>The second issue is, can you get the most out of it? This is a multi-part question, though, and covers the size of screen you\'re running, possible bottlenecks in your system (such as OS, CPU and memory) and whether your power supply can handle the extra draw that comes with a top-end graphics card. </p><p>Then it all comes down to which card, or combination of cards, suits you best. This is the key point – do you go for a single, high-performance model or opt for a (possibly cheaper) multi-GPU solution? It\'s all a bit complicated, isn\'t it? But have no fear: we\'ve handcuffed ourselves to the test-bench and won\'t move until we\'ve tried the top 20 graphics setups around today.</p><p><img alt=\"Graphics card\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.feature1.main_card-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p> Both Nvidia and AMD have released their most expensive and powerful graphics cards ever in the last few months. With the launch of the GTX 590 (Nvidia) and Radeon HD 6990 (AMD), the top of the market has never looked so good. But how do you get the most out of such outrageously priced components? </p><p>You want to make sure that, if you spend the best part of £600 on a graphics card, you\'re wringing as much potential as you can out of it. The one thing a top graphics card such as the dual-GPU GTX 590 or HD 6990 wants is a high-end display setup. A good, high-resolution desktop is going to push your expensive silicon to up its game, and will make sure you get the most out of its pixel-pushing prowess. </p><p><strong>Buffering up</strong></p><p>Both of the latest dual-GPU cards from the big-name manufacturers come with a frankly huge amount of graphics memory. The GTX 590 has a chunky 3GB of GDDR5 and the HD 6990 a positively bloated 4GB. It\'s these large frame buffers that help enable the cards to output at the crazy resolutions afforded by the multi-screen setups AMD and Nvidia are championing. </p><p>Just how much the frame buffer means is shown by the GTX 460. That appeared in both 768MB and 1GB trim, with the former version significantly worse at higher resolutions than its memory-laden brother. Either of them will breeze through any game you throw at it if you\'re running at resolutions such as 1,280 x 720, and even up to 1,680 x 1,050. But as soon as you go past the 1080p resolution of 1,920 x 1,080, lower-end cards such as the 768MB GTX 460 will start to struggle. </p><p>This is what you get when you drop £600 on a graphics card, then: the knowledge that it will cope at pretty much any resolution you throw its way. </p><p><strong>Five stars </strong></p><p>When AMD released the HD 6990, it came out blowing the trumpet of quint-screen gaming. For those who aren\'t aware of the phrase we just made up, it means five screens with a possible resolution of 5,400 x 1,920. That\'s five 1080p screens running in portrait mode, connected together. </p><p><img alt=\"ATI eyefinity\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.feature1.monitors-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The GTX 590, on the other hand, can only cope with three screens. It is, though, the first time Nvidia has released a single-GPU card that can output to more than two screens. Either way, it\'s a huge amount of screen real estate to play with.</p><p> If your graphics card can cope with that scale of resolution madness then you\'re surely onto a winner. You do have to be careful, though, because there aren\'t many games out there capable of taking full advantage of such screen size. Most can cope with the 30-inch panel\'s native resolution of 2,560 x 1,600, but few are able to deal with multi-monitor setups. </p><p><img alt=\"Dragon age 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.feature1.dragonage2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Take a look at the <em>Dragon Age 2</em> screenshot AMD supplied with its HD 6990 press material – with half of your HUD on screen one and the other on screen five, you\'re going to get whiplash fast. </p><p>Some games have been coded with the likes of AMD\'s Eyefinity panoramic technology in mind. They offer the chance to keep all the HUD elements on the central screen while still affording you the ultra-widescreen format. Five screens might be pushing it a little, but a three-screen setup capable of 1080p and above in portrait mode would be hitting the sweet spot. </p><p>There\'s one more thing to be aware of with a portrait setup, and that\'s the screen technology used. You\'ll need to make sure the monitor you choose has a decent viewing angle; something the traditional TN panel can\'t offer. </p><p>Ideally, then, you\'ll need to splash out on the more expensive IPS panels. Otherwise, the vertical viewing angle, which becomes the horizontal angle when put in portrait mode, will seriously impede your image quality. </p><p><strong>Space to burn</strong></p><p>So, once you\'ve made sure the display setup is in place, how do you ensure that your rig is up to the task? The first thing may seem obvious, but it\'s all about space. High-end graphics cards or multi-card setups need a lot of that.</p><p> The Radeon HD 6990 is the same size as the HD 5970 and, as such, is one of the longest cards you\'ll find on the market. It\'s worth making sure your chassis is capacious enough to cope with the extra few centimetres the big cards need. </p><p>On the next tier down, the HD 69xx cards are fairly chunky too, with the Nvidia models coming in a bit shorter and more likely to fit. Testing on a mid-size CM Storm Scout chassis, we found we could easily fit a GTX 580 inside. On the AMD front, though, the fastest card that would fit the case was the HD 6870. </p><p>That\'s not the only consideration, though. If you do manage to squeeze an HD 6990 into your case, you\'ll have to make sure there\'s enough airflow to avoid the thing suffocating and its silicon brains melting out of the choked vents. Top-end cards are, essentially, electric fan heaters. The amount of heat they generate can be directly attributed to the amount of power they need to run, so something like the GTX 590 is going to push out a lot of heat. </p><p>The new dual-GPU cards from AMD and Nvidia have both been set up with a symmetrical cooling design. Unfortunately, that means that just as much hot air is blown into the case as is vented out of the back. </p><p>The problem isn\'t quite so bad with multiple graphics card setups because, as with a single-GPU card, you can vent directly out of the back. Multi-card rigs will need to have space to breathe too, especially between the cards. If they\'re stacked on top of each other then you\'re going to end up with some seriously hot silicon. </p><p>The next concern is just how much power you\'re going to need to keep your graphical behemoths juiced up. Multi-GPU cards and SLI or CrossFire arrangements need an extraordinary amount of power just to get them up and running. </p><p>With something like the GTX 590, Nvidia recommend a 700W PSU as a minimum. If you\'re looking at the HD 6990 or a dual-GPU GTX 580 setup then you\'re probably going to need an 850W power supply. </p><p><img alt=\"PSU\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.feature1.corsair1200w-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Before you go out and spend the cash on a 1,500W PSU, though, it\'s worth remembering to make sure you\'ve got enough spare capacity, because an under-used high-end supply is far more inefficient than a lower-capacity unit running at the same power draw. </p><p>So a 700W supply drawing 500W is going to be much more efficient than a 1,500W PSU drawing the same 500W. PSU inefficiency means wasted energy, and that means excess heat. With high-end graphics cards, that can be dangerous. </p><p><strong>Letting the side down</strong></p><p>As well as checking ratings to cover the amount of power a particular card needs, there are other concerns. The latest dual-GPU cards make serious demands of your PSU\'s 12v rail. </p><p>Both the HD 6990 and GTX 590 have been designed to stay below the 375W maximum the twin 8-pin PCI Express power connectors and motherboard PCIe bus can supply, but when you factor in overclocking, that goes straight out of the window. </p><p>The HD 6990 comes with a BIOS switch that boosts the core clocks to the same settings as the HD 6970 GPUs the Antilles chips are based on. This increases the power draw to insane proportions, and can overload the 12v rail in lesser PSU lights. </p><p>We spoke to one of Enermax\'s PSU engineers about this at launch, and he explained that customers need to consider two things when purchasing a PSU for top-end graphics cards: \"The PSU should be equipped with OPP function, and should have a strong 12v line, or lines.\" </p><p>OPP means \'Over Power Protection\', and this technology shuts down the PSU if the graphics card is demanding more power than the 12v lines can give. So you don\'t get a cascade failure effect if the PSU falls over. </p><p>Another key consideration is your CPU. If your processor can\'t cope with the pace of your new graphics giant then you\'ll end up with a bottleneck in the system. This means that your expensive bit of silicon will be sitting there twiddling its transistors, waiting for the laggy CPU to catch up. A modern, multi-core CPU ought to be able to cope with anything a new game can throw at it, though. </p><p>Granted, a lowly AMD Athlon II dual core will still give you a bottleneck, as will a sub-2GHz Intel Core 2 Duo, but any Phenom II quad or Core i5 should keep things ticking over nicely. </p><p><strong>Double trouble? </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Lost planet 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.feature1.ost_planet2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>So, you\'ve made sure your chassis can house a beefy graphics setup, you\'ve sorted out a power supply that won\'t collapse and turn the insides of your gaming rig into pricey slag and you\'ve got a decent processor at the heart of your machine so the graphics don\'t get ahead of themselves. Now, what sort of high-end graphics setup do you want? </p><p>The options at the pricey end of the market are fairly wide ranging. At the very top you\'re looking at CrossFireX and quad-SLI setups, with four of AMD or Nvidia\'s top single-GPU cards being thrown together on one motherboard. That will create a graphical array more than capable of the highest resolutions games will realistically play at.</p><p> It\'s also entirely possible that it will create a black hole. In your wallet, that is. It\'s this sort of setup that makes the single PCB, multi-GPU cards more attractive, and seem like better value. That\'s quite a feat considering they cost about £600 themselves. </p><p>The benefit of these single-card solutions is that they take up far less space inside your machine. And if you\'re an Nvidia fan who\'s not blessed with an SLI-ready motherboard, you can now run a twin-GPU setup. If you do have an SLI-ready motherboard, though, and one that will happily support quad-SLI, then you could drop a pair of GTX 590s in for some serious graphical action. </p><p>The paucity of SLI-certified motherboards is only one of the problems with multi-GPU arrays, though with AMD\'s Bulldozer boards looking increasingly likely to support SLI, that situation could change. </p><p>But, still, driver problems persist when you add extra graphics processors. More often than not you\'ll find that the latest games don\'t work, or that you don\'t see one of your GPUs at launch. Then there\'s a wait for the driver issues to be sorted out by the relevant manufacturers. </p><p>This isn\'t an exclusive problem to either Nvidia or AMD – they\'re both as bad as each other now. A fast, single-GPU card will save you headaches down the line, then, as well as a fair bit of cash. But if you absolutely must have the highest frame rates then multi-GPU options are the way forward. </p><p>Looking down the spectrum and pairing up a couple of lower-end GPUs, such as a couple of GTX 460s, will net you performance that will make anyone who forked out for a GTX 580 a little green around the gills. Why stop at two GPUs, though? </p><p>The performance of twin cards has gone through the roof in recent years, to the point where we\'re close to doubling the performance. But, unfortunately, adding in more cards is very much a case of diminishing returns. With the performance boost you get, the second card is totally worthwhile. A third or fourth addition, though, will barely register. </p><p>We tested a pair of GTX 590s and a pair of HD 6990s and it was rare indeed that we saw a significant improvement in performance. Heaven 2.5 was the only benchmark that used the four GPUs properly, nearly netting double the performance. The rest of our benchmarking suite ably showed just why SLI and CrossFire performance is so hit and miss. </p><p><em>Aliens vs Predator</em> only showed an increase with Nvidia\'s GPUs, <em>Lost Planet 2</em> gave extremely poor returns and <em>DiRT2</em> went backwards when we dropped in a second HD 6990. </p><p><strong>Up the resolution</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Crysis 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.feature1.crysis2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Finally, it\'s important to consider what you\'re going to be using your high-end graphics setup for: gaming. The problem at the moment is that because of the cost of games development, most publishers are focusing their efforts on the consoles. That\'s where the big profits lie. </p><p>The PC is more powerful than any console, a fact shown by all the recent TV ads for multi-platform games, clearly using PC footage to make sales. Unfortunately, though, PC games are still being held back by the lowest console denominator – it\'s simply not worth the developers\' time to push a game for PC hardware. </p><p>So we come back round to the start, and what it is that\'s going to really take advantage of your serious graphics hardware. Namely, large resolutions. At normal resolutions of 1680 x 1050 and 1920 x 1080, PC games are still quite a way from really pushing top-end GPUs. It\'s only when you jump into the upper echelons of 2560 x 1600 and above that these expensive beasts start to come into their own. </p><p>Should you go out and buy a seriously expensive graphics setup? If you have a hankering for some crazy screen real estate, then hell yeah. If not, you might not need to part with £1,200 for a pair of GTX 590s. </p><p>There\'s still a wealth of graphical options lower down the scale, though. We\'ve benched 20 different setups to give you the lowdown. Turn the page to find out what we\'ve discovered in testing.</p><p><strong>1.

As the first of its Northern Island codenamed graphics cards, it\'s certainly the quickest AMD has come out with. </p><p>The big problem, though, is the second-tier card released alongside it – the HD 6950. But we\'ll come to that later. </p><p>The Cayman XT at the heart of the HD 6970 is essentially the same GPU as paired in the Antilles chip of the dual-GPU HD 6990. It\'s clocked faster than the stock specs of the Antilles, though – through the shaky-ground magic of the Antilles Unlocking Switch (also known as the Screw Your Warranty Switch) the HD 6990 can run with its GPUs at the same speed as the HD 6970. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/graphics-cards/his-radeon-hd-6970-962522/review\">Read the full HIS Radeon HD 6970 review</a></p><p><strong>5.

But in our eyes, this is the finest graphics card AMD has produced in a long time. In the sub-£200 market, it\'s as good as you\'re going to get, and it\'s a card that offers much more than any of the opposition. </p><p>In its plain state, the HD 6950 comes close to the HD 6970 performance-wise, and to the GTX 570 too. The 2GB GDDR5 frame buffer means it can keep pace with Nvidia\'s second-tier Fermi card, although for the most part it does lag behind slightly. It does the same with the HD 6970, but that\'s to be expected from a card that\'s much, much cheaper.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/graphics-cards/sapphire-radeon-hd-6950-2gb-958760/review\">Read the full Sapphire Radeon HD 6950 review</a></p><p><strong>7.

It would make no sense for Nvidia to kill off one of the best cards it\'s launched since the halcyon days of the 8800 GT.</p><p> But it\'s not quite as simple as just being another transistor-level tweak of the GTX 470 design. The GTX 560 Ti is more of a halfway house between the GTX 470 and GTX 460. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/graphics-cards/msi-geforce-gtx-560-ti-962535/review\">Read the full MSI GeForce GTX 560 Ti review</a></p><p><strong>8.

That\'s not value as in \'value\' toilet paper – it\'s all about the price, and not necessarily the performance. </p><p>With the HD 6870, you\'d only be looking at this card if you really couldn\'t afford to spend a pound more than its listed price. That\'s not to say it\'s a bad card. It compares favourably with the marginally more expensive GTX 560 Ti, though when we first saw it at launch, the combination of relatively high price point (£200 at release) and older technology meant it got a fairly poor reception. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/graphics-cards/xfx-radeon-hd-6870-962549/review\">Read the full XFX Radeon HD 6870 Ti review</a></p><p><strong>9.

Nvidia has had a long history of creating superb mid-range cards, from the 6600 GT to the incredible 8800 GT, and the GTX 460 can sit happily among such illustrious forebears. </p><p>Based on the same Fermi architecture as the hot-and-heavy GTX 480, the GTX 460 carries the torch into the lower end of the price spectrum. At launch it was priced at £200, the same as the GTX 560 Ti when it was first released. However, thanks to the passage of time, you can now pick up an overclocked 1GB version for as little as £120. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/graphics-cards/evga-geforce-gtx-460-1gb-ftw-edition-900025/review\">Read the full EVGA GTX 460 1GB review</a></p><p><strong>10.

Now available for as little as £132, it\'s about the same price as the GTX 460, and just about had it pipped to the post in most of our benchmarking suite. </p><p>Like the HD 6870 before it, it\'s based on the same Barts GPU, a reworking of the GPU at the heart of AMD\'s last generation of DirectX 11 graphics cards, the HD 58xx series. In real terms, though, this card was brought in to replace the excellent HD 5770, despite what the naming structure may have you believe. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/graphics-cards/sapphire-radeon-hd-6850-962568/review\">Read the full Sapphire Radeon HD 6850 review</a></p><p><strong>Bench analysis: Making sense of an awful lot of numbers </strong></p><p>Because of the awesome amount of graphical power at our fingertips, with this latest batch of DirectX 11 cards all of the benchmarks below represent their performance at the very highest single-screen resolution possible; 2,560x1,600. </p><p>With the really intensive DirectX 11 benchmarks you can see a clear divide between the top contenders for the top GPU crown and the alsorans. Heaven 2.5 though shows a nice, smooth gradient as you move down the power order, but you can see with the incredibly demanding <em>Metro 2033</em> that there is a definite step where the cards simply cannot provide enough graphical grunt to run the game at such high resolutions. </p><p>Even the GTX 570 fails to get into double figures in SLI. It\'s here the HD 6950 shows its muscles, keeping pace with the GTX 580 in this most demanding of benchmarks. </p><p>The multi-GPU performance is interesting too, with only the synthetic Heaven 2.5 test showing consistent GPU scaling with up to four GPUs. And talking of multi-GPU the power of twin budget cards, like the GTX 460 and HD 6850, proves a match for single, pricier options. </p><p><img alt=\"bench 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/gpu-bench1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><img alt=\"bench 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/GPU-Bench2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>And the winners are... </strong></p><p><strong>Nvidia GeForce GTX 580 AMD Radeon HD 6950 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"GTX 580\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_group.zotac_gtx580b-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>With so much choice in the graphics card arena it can be tough to make a definitive call on what the best cards are for what purposes. There are some standout performers in the test and some weaker options which you can almost discount immediately.</p><p> At the top end though things are incredibly tight. In terms of pure, out of the box performance you\'d have to side with the GTX 590 as the three-screen hero single card. But with the frankly obscene performance of the GTX 580 in SLI, and despite the price-tag, we\'d have to go for the separate, faster cards in SLI over the single-PCB, multi-GPU GTX 590. </p><p>AMD\'s HD 6990 comes in behind them, though with the ability to power up to five screens through its EyeFinity tech. With the, admittedly warranty-voiding, Antilles Unlocking Switch making overclocking the card as easy as flicking a switch (and hoping your PSU doesn\'t fall over) the HD 6990 actually does have a lot going for it. </p><p>Neither multi-GPU card though looks good in quad-GPU trim. Neither camp\'s drivers are really up to snuff, with only the Heaven 2.5 benchmark actually scaling properly. And driver problems, even with two GPUs, can mean a wait, post game release, for your cards to be supported. </p><p>Which makes a single GTX 580 a fantastic proposition on its own, it\'s fast, though does lack proper multi-monitor support. So Nvidia\'s top card becomes a double winner in single and SLI flavours. </p><p><img alt=\"HD 6950\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20253/PCF253.w_group.radeon_hd6950b-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>AMD\'s top single-GPU card, the HD 6970, while being a decent card in of itself, is actually hampered by its own brethren. The HD 6950, in its default, vanilla flavour is almost as fast as the top AMD single-GPU card and for almost £100 less. Combined with the outstanding performance of the GTX 570 makes the 6970 impossible to recommend. </p><p>In the mid-range there really is only one winner, and that\'s the HD 6950. On its own it\'s a great performing card, keeping pace with both the HD 6970 and the GTX 570. If you factor in the unlocking potential and subsequent overclocking chops that turns it into a monster of a card for under £200. </p><p>You can also pick up two of them for the same price as a single GTX 580 and give Nvidia\'s top GPU a darned good thrashing while you\'re at it. </p><p>So if you\'re looking at a single, high-resolution monitor then Nvidia\'s GTX 580 will come without any driver hassle and keep your games looking great. For a serious multi-screen setup it has to be an AMD card, and personally I\'d opt for a pair of unlocked HD 6950s, though the HD 6990, PSU-willing, will deliver incredible performance.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/15fc4c73/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/14da0f96/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cgraphics0Ecards0Chow0Eto0Eupgrade0Eyour0Egraphics0Ecard0Ecooling0E9544970Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to upgrade your graphics card cooling</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/162bb548/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cgraphics0Ecards0Chow0Eto0Eoverclock0Ethe0Egtx0E590A0E9693810Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to overclock the GTX 590</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415075/s/169856f7/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Ecomponents0Cgraphics0Ecards0Camd0Eradeon0Ehd0E6990Am0Eworld0Es0Efastest0Emobile0Egpu0Eunveiled0E9780A380Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewscomput/story01.htm\">AMD Radeon HD 6990M - world\'s fastest mobile GPU unveiled</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Graphics+cards+compared%3A+10+rated&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fgraphics-cards%2Fgraphics-cards-compared-10-rated-961826%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Graphics+cards+compared%3A+10+rated&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing-components%2Fgraphics-cards%2Fgraphics-cards-compared-10-rated-961826%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewscomput\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/104472400061/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/15fc4c73/kg/201-216-218-221-239/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/104472400061/u/49/f/415075/c/669/s/15fc4c73/kg/201-216-218-221-239/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~4/gLir5FjZEK0\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/computing-components-news/~3/gLir5FjZEK0/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/computing-components\n',33202,NULL,'2011-06-18 11:00:00'),(95,'Exclusive: Windows 8 UI was being planned before Apple\'s iPad launched','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/software/operating-systems/windows8/June2011/windows8-june2011-2-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Microsoft started work on what is going to be released as <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/windows-8-everything-you-need-to-know-701764\">Windows 8</a> for ARM before Apple\'s iPad had even been launched, according to corporate VP Dan\'l Lewin. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/microsoft-we-know-where-we-re-going-with-windows-8-tablets-966757\">Speaking to TechRadar</a>, Lewin suggested that the tile layout which will be a major new feature in Windows 8 on tablet devices, has not been informed by Apple\'s successful iPad. </p><p>\"Think about when the planning started for what you saw just the other day;

You bet! Read on to learn why IFA 2011 could be the most significant in years.</p><p><strong>IFA firsts</strong></p><p>IFA is not just another gadget show. It\'s a technology event on an enormous scale. Last year, the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin attracted over 230,000 visitors. And yes, it is open to the public.</p><p>Indeed, the IFA site is so huge it has its own transport system to help get folks around. With more attendees and exhibition space than CES, it can legitimately claim to be the world\'s biggest tech expo.</p><p>Amazingly, the show first opened its doors way back in 1924. Since then it\'s seen numerous tech milestones.</p><p>In 1930 Albert Einstein gave a keynote speech about the future of radio; five years later the event introduced the first magnetic recording tape. In 1967 PAL colour televisions made their debut, and then in 1981 CD players were unveiled before a curious public. It was at IFA, in 1995, that European broadcasters began to demonstrate digital TV for the first time. </p><p>So what will IFA 2011 will be remembered for?</p><p><strong>Big buzzwords</strong></p><p>Naturally, the big brands are keeping product announcements and developments close to their chests, as they prepare for the big IFA reveal on 1 September. Until then rumour and speculation is the name of the game. That said, it\'s not too difficult to predict the direction that tech winds will be blowing.</p><p>The big buzzwords bouncing around the halls of IFA 2011 will be (in no particular order) 4K2K, Smart TV, autostereocopic 3D and tablets. Feel free to combine any and all of these to produce your imaginary device of choice.</p><p>Those who have been hoping that the 3D bandwagon would at least develop a slow puncture (yes, amazingly there are a few naysayers still out there) are likely to be disappointed. The big 3D TV makers will all be hawking better-than-ever third generation displays.</p><p>One highlight you can expect to see in the Panasonic hall is the brand\'s astonishing new 152inch 3D plasma. We\'ve already had a preview of this monster and can confirm it is quite simply the most jaw-dropping flat-panel on the planet. </p><p>Panasonic has long enjoyed producing impractically large plasmas (just because it can), and this is its most ambitious screen yet. The 4K Active Shutter panel has a resolution of 8 million pixels; at a recent demo we watched in slack-jawed amazement as it upscaled <em>Avatar</em> from a standard Panasonic 3D Blu-ray player. </p><p>2011 has already been deemed the year of the smart TV by the likes of Samsung and LG, and this message is only likely to be reinforced at IFA 2011. While Ethernet is now de rigueur on all types of CE gear, Wi-Fi has been an awkward add-on. However, come IFA, the dongle will go the way of the Dodo, as building-in becomes the new going out.</p><p><strong>Back to the future</strong></p><p>IFA has a habit of repeating itself. So expect those uber-cool products unveiled at IFA 2010, but still conspicuous by their absence in the real world, to return refreshed. We\'ll bet dollars to doughnuts that you\'ll witness the second coming of LG\'s fabled Nano-LED TVs, only this time with Cinema 3D passive tech replacing the Active Shutter 3D system they were originally shown with.</p><p><img alt=\"LG nano\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/events/IFA_2011/LG%20NAno%20LED-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>BACK AGAIN:</strong> <em>First shown last year, but still not on sale, LG\'s Nano LED screens will get a Passive 3D makeover at IFA</em></p><p>Of course, LG will still be shilling gear unlikely to ship anytime soon. We predict the highlight of the LG hall will be its first large screen 4K2K 3D display. This will use the brand\'s proprietary FPR (Film Pattern Retarder) filter and, thanks to the higher resolution of the 4K panel, will be able to produce the first ever Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080) Passive 3D picture. </p><p>LG\'s rival Samsung does not traditionally use IFA to launch swathes of new kit, reserving that privilege for January\'s CES event. However, the company does like to steal a headline or two. One way it could do this is by taking the wraps off its own radical new 3D TV technology. </p><p>The brand is known to have done a deal with 3D pioneer Real D to create a new generation of displays which deliver Full HD 3D using passive polarising glasses. No specifics have been announced, but by shifting shuttering LCD tech to the panel and away from high-tech eyeware, the brand will free itself from the expensive handcuffs that are Active Shutter spectacles.</p><p>Over in Toshiba\'s hall, there\'s certain to be a massive push on autostereoscopic (no glasses needed) 3D. We predict Toshiba will show a groundbreaking 55inch Auto-3D screen. The company has already touted prototypes and seems firmly committed to making autostereocopic TV happen. Of course, you won\'t be able to buy one until at least 2012. </p><p><strong>The evolution of the tablet</strong></p><p>Naturally, tablets will be everywhere at IFA 2011, with dozens of cookie-cutter slates on hand. What will be new, however, is how they\'ll be positioned. Many of these handhelds will be promoted as your next second TV screen. </p><p>Samsung used IFA 2010 to launch its original Samsung Galaxy Tab and it looks like the company will be using this year\'s show to launch a follow-up device - the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/samsung-galaxy-q-what-you-need-to-know-981656\">Samsung Galaxy Q</a>. The rumour is that it\'s a \"tabphone\" that\'s half tablet, half phone. Read more about the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/samsung-galaxy-q-what-you-need-to-know-981656\">Samsung Galaxy Q here</a>. </p><p>We know that Panasonic\'s first tablets will allow you to access its Viera Connect IPTV and apps store directly, as well as act as a turbo-charged remote control for a tethered screen. </p><p><img alt=\"Viera tablet\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/events/IFA_2011/VIERA%20tablet-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>TABLET FRENZY:</strong> <em>A new wave of tablet devices will launch, aimed at enhancing the TV viewing experience</em></p><p>IFA 2011 won\'t just be about hardware, though. Reflecting the rise of Smart devices, there will be a new emphasis on apps and content. </p><p>Samsung UK\'s AV marketing chief Russell Owens says that IFA 2011 will be about more than just kit. \"You can be certain apps and services will be a big story at this year\'s event,\" he told us. </p><p>Sony spokesperson Lucie Speciale agrees, saying that for Sony IFA 2011 will be about \"discovering new services and most importantly experiencing digital content in ways that haven\'t been seen before.\" She adds \"key themes will be connectivity, mobility, entertainment and the next stages of 3D.\" </p><p>We can\'t wait. </p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16ef9c3a/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td

Marshall: Who wants a Firefox phone?','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/logos/Mozilla_Foundation_logo-200-200.jpg\" /><p>You\'ve got to admire Mozilla. This is an organisation whose people don\'t know the word \"can\'t\". </p><p>If Mozilla had a disappointing holiday at Butlin\'s, it wouldn\'t bother writing an angry letter: it\'d promise to build its own holiday camp and let everybody in for free.</p><p>Mozilla\'s biggest claim to fame, of course, is Firefox: faced with Microsoft\'s effective monopoly on web browsers, Mozilla built a better browser, spread the word and rebooted the web. So it\'s interesting to see the organisation\'s latest target: Google.</p><p>Mozilla isn\'t happy about two things. It\'s unhappy about the way that apps are segregating the web, with native apps able to access smartphone and tablet hardware that web-based apps can\'t; and it\'s unhappy that with Android, Google appears to be more mouth than trousers. For all Google\'s talk of openness and sharing with the open source community, there are often long delays between Google releasing new versions of Android and sharing its code with the wider world.</p><p>Mozilla\'s solution is codenamed <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/mozilla-looks-to-develop-mobile-operating-system-983342\">Boot To Gecko</a>, and it promises to be a brand new mobile OS. But will it work?</p><p><strong>\'Roid rage</strong></p><p>There\'s no doubt that Android has issues - not just the speed of Google\'s sharing, but <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/schmidt-hits-out-over-android-lawsuits-981110\">the patent claims</a> that threaten to disrupt Android\'s momentumand scare manufacturers - and Mozilla is absolutely right that web apps could be as good as native ones. </p><p>Apple\'s desire to get a cut of everything that\'s viewable on a Retina Display hardly instils confidence, and Microsoft would no doubt try similar antics if it had the market share.</p><p>What worries me is that Mozilla\'s solution won\'t work. It\'s a tough one to call, because so far Boot to Gecko is a topic for discussion rather than a defined plan, but it looks like there are two main possibilities here: an alternative OS that Android users have to seek out, install and then boot into when they want to use its apps, or a whole new mobile OS.</p><p>If it\'s the former, it\'s not going to give Google anything to worry about. And if it\'s the latter, I fear Mozilla is trying to punch above its weight. A rival operating system is whole different ball game, desktop Linux versus Windows rather than Firefox versus Internet Explorer, and it\'s one where I fear Mozilla isn\'t big enough or strong enough to compete.</p><p>Creating a popular mobile OS is a battle on multiple fronts, and the technology is almost irrelevant. No matter how good your tech, you need to persuade handset manufacturers to build devices running it; you need to persuade mobile phone operators to stock and support it; you need to persuade app developers to code for it; and you need to persuade end users to buy it. Fail to win over any one of those groups and you might as well stay in bed.</p><p>That\'s Nokia-scale stuff, BlackBerry-scale stuff, Microsoft-scale stuff, and even those firms are finding things difficult in mobile: Nokia\'s MeeGo adventure <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/why-is-nokia-keeping-quiet-about-the-n9-os--968836\">appears to be over</a>, RIM\'s <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/rim-begins-layoffs-10-per-cent-of-workforce-to-go-983129\">laying off staff</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/windows-phone-still-very-small-admits-ballmer-977878\">Microsoft admits</a> that Windows Phone isn\'t doing the numbers it\'d like.</p><p>I think Mozilla\'s right when it warns that the mobile web is becoming increasingly closed. But I can\'t help thinking that unless it gets a Google-sized backer, it\'s planning to bring a spud gun to a tank battle.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

/><p>Competition among tablets is fiercer than ever. The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/hp-touchpad-972226/review\">HP TouchPad</a> is out, and there are a handful of compelling <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/14-best-android-tablets-in-the-world-905504\">Android tablets</a> available now. Even the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/blackberry-playbook-947731/review\">BlackBerry PlayBook</a> has a lot to offer. </p><p><p>Meanwhile, Microsoft - who never garnered much interest for the Tablet PC platform - has announced that Windows 8 will run on computers and on a new breed of <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/windows-8-tablets-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-916134\">Windows 8 tablets</a>. </p><p>Details are sketchy, however. Here are 8 must-have Windows tablet features we want to see at launch.</p><p><strong>1. True multitasking<br /> </strong></p><p>If Windows tablets do not provide real multi-tasking, and instead work more like a Windows Phone, the platform will start off slowly. On the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/blackberry-playbook-947731/review\">PlayBook</a>, you can run a game in the background and it will continue to run. You can even upload files to <a href=\"http://www.dropbox.com\">Dropbox</a> and switch over to your e-mail and send attachments. On a Win 8 tablet, multitasking would be a major differentiator.</p><p><img alt=\"Multitask\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mobile-computing/Tablets%20and%20touchscreens/win8tabs/multitasking-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>MULTITASK: </strong><em>On the BlackBerry PlayBook, games will run in the background even if you switch to a different app. Windows 8 tablets need to follow that lead; apps should not just pause</em></p><p><strong>2. Outlook Cloud</strong></p><p>Microsoft has experimented with cloud email since the original Hotmail, yet they\'ve kept the basic Outlook client in tact. (Exchange Online is a step in the right direction, though.) On a tablet, Outlook should become a full cloud-based client like Gmail. On your computer, a Windows Phone 7 device, or Windows tablet all email should be a click away.</p><p><strong>3. Zune video rentals</strong></p><p>Not all Android tablets offer a video store - the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/motorola-xoom-933048/review\">Motorola Zoom</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/htc-flyer-32gb-3g--955996/review\">HTC Flyer</a> do, but not many others. Microsoft will likely port Zune software to tablets, offering video downloads as they do now on a Windows Phone. To compete with Netflix, Microsoft should also offer a monthly plan to stream at least a few major Hollywood releases and not just for-rent downloads.</p><p><strong>4. New touch features<br /> </strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/62-windows-7-tips-tricks-and-secrets-643861\">Windows 7</a> hinted at some innovative touch features - on a touchscreen laptop, you could spin a globe, rotate photos, and play a few touch-enabled games. Windows 8 needs to go beyond what Apple offers with the iPad and include quick gestures for deleting emails, photo rotation, and a new way to control games. The challenge is to make the most powerful apps, say for project management or video editing, work with gestures, zooming, and swipes.</p><p><img alt=\"Gestures\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mobile-computing/Tablets%20and%20touchscreens/win8tabs/gestures-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>GESTURES:</strong> <em>Gesture control on an Android tablet means swiping through a music library and zooming in on photos. Windows 8 tablets need to go even further and offer swipe gestures for email and other apps</em></p><p><strong>5. Grouped documents</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/hp-touchpad-972226/review\">HP TouchPad</a> enables you to group documents together even if they are from different apps. On a Windows tablet, we want a feature for grouping documents from Excel and Word, add related emails, and even Internet Explorer pages using the tile interface. This grouping would help organize projects in the same way you\'d group files on a computer. A way to then e-mail all grouped docs would be a bonus.</p><p><strong>6. Full Office apps</strong></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/tablets/apple-ipad-2-935199/review\">Apple iPad</a> lets you view and edit Office documents, but not with full desktop-like applications. Windows 8 tablets provide the Office suite for editing rich documents, making pivot tables in Excel and adding charts, and making PowerPoint slide sin a way that competes with Keynote (templates, slide-sharing). And, each app needs to print over Wi-Fi. </p><p><strong>7. Surface mode</strong></p><p>Here\'s a unique feature that could set Windows tablets apart. Microsoft should take what they have learned with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/hands-on-microsoft-surface-2-920434\">Surface Table</a> and move it to the small screen. This should include two-player chess and checkers, shared photos that multiple people can stretch and rotate, and a full-screen browser that works faster than Google Chrome on a desktop machine.</p><p><img alt=\"Microsoft surface\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mobile-computing/Tablets%20and%20touchscreens/win8tabs/surface-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>SURFACE:</strong> <em>Microsoft Surface is a multiuser touchscreen table, but many of the concepts could be ported to Windows 8 tablets</em></p><p><strong>8. Ported Xbox 360 content<br /> </strong></p><p>We want to see a version of <em>Halo </em>running on <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/windows-8-tablets-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-916134\">Windows 8 tablets</a> at launch, plus other Xbox 360 games like <em>Gears of War</em>. Too much to ask? If Microsoft really wants to dethrone Apple, it should start by making the Windows 8 tablet the go-to platform for games, include achievements and link into the console version of the game -- maybe even as an extra controller.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16edf083/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16d80ce0/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Cus0Egovernment0Egives0Eblackberry0Eplaybook0Ethe0Ethumbs0Eup0E9818450Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">US government gives BlackBerry PlayBook the thumbs up</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16da7800/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Ctablet0Esales0Eup0E30A0A0Eyear0Eon0Eyear0E9820A320Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Tablet sales up 300% year on year</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16e6e83c/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Ccurrys0Egets0Esamsung0Egalaxy0Etab0E10A0E10Ehead0Estart0E9829410Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Currys gets Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 head start</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16edfb07/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Candroid0E20E30Eupdate0Earrives0Efor0Esamsung0Egalaxy0Etab0E9835870Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Android 2.3 update arrives for Samsung Galaxy Tab</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16ef4029/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Cfirst0Ehtc0Epuccini0Epictures0Eunveiled0E9836880Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Detailed HTC Puccini pictures unveiled</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=In+Depth%3A+Windows+tablets%3A+8+features+we+want+to+see&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fmobile-computing%2Ftablets%2Fwindows-tablets-8-features-we-want-to-see-983540%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsmobile\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=In+Depth%3A+Windows+tablets%3A+8+features+we+want+to+see&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fmobile-computing%2Ftablets%2Fwindows-tablets-8-features-we-want-to-see-983540%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsmobile\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877767615/u/49/f/415081/c/669/s/16edf083/kg/216-239-240-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877767615/u/49/f/415081/c/669/s/16edf083/kg/216-239-240-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/mobile-computing-news/~4/5Uhe-m3XmaA\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/mobile-computing-news/~3/5Uhe-m3XmaA/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/mobile-computing\n',9328,NULL,'2011-07-26 12:03:00'),(101,'Buying Guide: 10 best laptops for students','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/mobile-computing/notebooks-and-tablet-pcs/Samsung/samsung-nc110-3-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Seeing back to school signs in the shops is arguably the most depressing part of the school summer holidays. But as soon as you become a student it becomes positively rapturous. </p><p><p>There are a lot of things to be excited about, and choosing a decent computer to last the duration of your course is one of them. We\'ve scoured our peerless laptop reviews to search out 10 of the laptops that are best for students. </p><p>We mainly picked cheap laptops - after all, scholars aren\'t renowned for being flush for cash - but we\'ve added a few for more specific courses.</p><p><strong>1. Toshiba NB550D - £262</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Toshiba nb550d\" src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Laptop/WLT%20148/WLT148.solo.toshiba2_1-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Netbooks are great for students: they\'re light, compact and cheap. Unfortunately, they\'re usually woefully underpowered. Toshiba\'s netbook bucks the trend by including AMD Fusion graphics, which mean it\'s capable of playing HD videos and photo editing. It\'s well designed, too, with nice speakers, a bright screen, and a tough, rubberised finish. The responsive keyboard and a large touchpad make it a pleasure to use. Unlike you, it won\'t fall asleep in lengthy lectures - the battery lasts for an incredible 10 hours.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/toshiba-nb550d-939235/review\">Read our Toshiba NB550D review</a></p><p><strong>2. Acer Aspire 5741Z - £290</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Acer aspire 5741z\" src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Laptop/WLT%20152/WLT152.rev1.acer_1-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>For less than £300, you can pick up this 15.6-inch laptop, which is surprisingly fully-featured for a machine so cheap. Its Pentium P6000 processor may be maturing, but it can still make mincemeat of multitasking, as well as full HD video playback and advanced photo editing. The HDMI port means it can be connected to a TV, and it\'s fairly lightweight with a decent 250 minutes of battery life. Add to this the brushed-metal finish and you\'ve got a laptop that looks and performs like one twice its price.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/acer-aspire-5741z-970057/review\">Read our Acer Aspire 5741Z review</a></p><p><strong>3.

Specifications are basic but perfectly adept, battery life weighs in at a good seven hours, and it\'s all wrapped up in a nice-looking chassis. For better or worse Samsung has pre-installed a lot of software on the NC110, but we actually found some of it rather handy, such as a WiFi finding tool. It\'s ideal for students who want something that looks the part.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-nc110-966868/review\">Read our Samsung NC110 review</a></p><p><strong>4.

Its colourful design and bright screen certainly make it stand out, and it\'s light and thin enough to stick in your rucksack next to your four pack of Carling, flute, and tatty copy of The Bell Jar. Performance wise it\'s up to the standard word processing and web browsing, but it also packs 524 minutes of battery life.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/packard-bell-dot-se-950918/review\">Read our Packard Bell Dot SE review</a></p><p><strong>5.

Internally it\'s nicely fleshed out, too, with 3GB of DDR3 RAM and a 320GB hard drive. It\'s got an impressive screen, but where the X32A really impresses is in its hidden extras. Boot into its Linux OS and you\'ve got a quick-loading operating system that allows for web browsing, Skype and email without killing the battery. When you need Windows 7 it\'s there too, in its 64-bit Home Premium flavour.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/asus-x32a-980248/review\">Read our Asus X32A review</a></p><p><strong>6.

USB 3.0 is provided for quick file transfers, and Asus\'s own ExpressGate lets you jump on the internet quickly and easily. There\'s even a fingerprint scanner to stop people cribbing your essays. Its battery lasts for an impressive six hours, and the screen is vibrant and bright. At £350 it\'s the most expensive netbook in this round-up, but it\'s worth paying for the added extras.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/asus-eee-pc-1018p-939410/review\">Read our Asus Eee PC 1018P review</a></p><p><strong>7.

It\'s fully-featured for such a modestly-priced laptop, too, cramming 6GB RAM, a Core i3 350M processor and an ATi Mobility Radeon HD5470 graphics chip into its case. We were slightly deflated by the build quality and battery life, but it\'s ideal as a desktop replacement that occasionally wanders into lectures. Much like students themselves.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/hp-pavilion-dv6-3112sa-957695/review\">Read our HP Pavilion DV6-3112sa review</a></p><p><strong>8.

This means it\'s capable of video and photo editing, making it perfect for media or photography students. We weren\'t happy with the keyboard (especially the \"strange, blocky font\"), but the trackpad and build quality more than made up for it. The battery lasted an impressive 333 minutes, and despite its bulkiness it\'s still fairly portable.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/msi-cx640-018uk-958303/review\">Read our MSI CX640-018UK review</a></p><p><strong>9.

It\'s incredibly well-designed, and it\'ll suit even the smartest business student. Add to this the sharp display, phenomenal keyboard and solid performance and it\'s an all-round winner, and its light weight and five hour battery life only adds to it. On the downside there\'s no DVD drive and its ultra-fast solid state drive only contains 128GB, but who cares when it looks and feels this good?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/dell-adamo-13-585789/review\">Read our Dell Adamo 13 review</a></p><p><strong>10.

It combines some of the better aspects of netbooks – namely, convenience, portability and streamlined dedication – with the more comfortable dimensions of a full-sized laptop. The 11.6-inch LED screen is bright and clear, and won\'t strain your eyes when you\'re working in programs with a lot of white space, like word processors. The Aspire One 721 also weighs just 1.40kg and at only 1.1-inches thick, it\'s easy to carry along with books and other studying materials. </p><p><a

coming</strong></p><p>It\'s been a bit of a wait for the Samsung Galaxy Tab follow-up, given that Samsung decided to hold it back and slim it down after the release of the slinky iPad 2. </p><p>Vodafone originally had the exclusive on the chunkier slate, dubbed the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1v-965649/review\">Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1V</a>, but that\'s now been axed and the Weight Watchers\' edition will go on general release when it launches. </p><p>The Honeycomb-running tablet comes with a front-facing camera, a 1GHz dual-core Nvidia Tegra 2 processor and full Flash capability; we branded it the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/samsung-galaxy-tab-10-1-965650/review\">best Android tablet yet in our 4.5 star review</a>. </p><p>With the Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 UK price starting at just £399 (the same price as the lowest-spec iPad 2), it\'s expected to make tablet waves when it lands in August. </p><p> </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16e6e83c/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a

You can also use the arrow keys on their own to move the cursor around, so no more dragging your finger and squinting at the on-screen magnifier to position it. </p><p>Apple sells a dock for the original iPad with a keyboard attached to it, but a Bluetooth model gives you more freedom, both in terms of the devices you can use it with (these keyboards should work with Macs and PCs, too) and when it comes to your setup. </p><p>So you could pop your iPhone in a dock on a shelf at eye-height and the keyboard on your desk. Or, when you\'re on the train with your iPad, stand it on the table and pop the keyboard just in front. The possibilities are endless, and you\'ll be able to type away for hours, provided you pick the right keyboard for your needs. </p><p>Do you need something that\'s small and easy to slip into a bag, or does size not matter, so long as you can type on it for long periods? Four of these run on batteries, so make sure you carry spares with you. The only exception is the iGo, which has built-in batteries that charge using a micro-USB connection. Lastly, the iGo Bluetooth Keyboard was also formerly known as the Adapt ADK-200; some sites still sell it as this. </p><p><strong>What we tested... </strong></p><p><strong>Apple Wireless Keyboard - £57</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Apple wireless keyboard\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keys_apple-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Freedom i-Connex - £60 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"i-Connex\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.iconnex-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>iGo Bluetooth Keyboard - £62 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"iGo\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keys_key2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>KeySonic KSK-3201MacBT - £38 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"KeySonic ksk\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keys_keysonic-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Macally BTKeyMini - £70 </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Macally\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.macally-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><img alt=\"iConnex\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.iconnex-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>We spent long periods typing on each of these keyboards to find out just how usable they are for extended reams of prose. How comfortable are they on the fingers? How fast can you type and how many mistakes do you make? </p><p>To be able to type quickly and without errors, you need the keys to be where you\'d expect them to be, especially things like the punctuation and numbers. And in trying to squash so many keys into a small and folding unit, the i-Connex becomes tricky to use. </p><p>We found ourselves making a lot of mistakes, and to compound matters, then missed the very small backspace key. The number keys along the top aren\'t exactly where you expect them to be in relation to the rest of the keys, either. </p><p>The KeySonic model, on the other hand, despite the key area being the same size as the i-Connex, is simply a slightly shrunk version of a full computer keyboard, and is far easier to use. We quickly found ourselves typing away at speed, with few mistakes. The action of the keys is wonderfully light and they\'re all where you\'d expect them to be. </p><p>The same is true for the Apple model, although the keys are in fact the same size as a regular computer keyboard, so you won\'t need to get used to a smaller size – simply set it up and start typing. Again, the key action is perfect – just enough resistance to let you know you\'ve pressed the keys, but light enough not to place too much strain on your fingers. </p><p>The Macally keyboard, despite being very light and compact, doesn\'t lend itself to fast or error-free typing (you\'d be amazed at the number of errors we made typing this sentence alone on it). Like the i-Connex, in squashing all the keys into a small space, Macally has taken liberties with key placement, most irritating of which is the apostrophe. While it\'s not far from where you\'d expect it, we kept hitting Enter instead – intensely annoying. </p><p>Lastly, the iGo has also shifted a couple of keys around, and indeed done away with the right Shift key altogether, causing much angst for your Mario Teaches Typing-trained reviewer. But since the majority of keys are where you\'d expect them to be, and because the key action is just so pleasant, we actually found ourselves rather liking the keyboard. The slightly rubberised keytops feel great to type on and the action is the lightest of all those on test here – something for which our RSI-prone fingers were thankful. </p><p><strong>Test results</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Test 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/test1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Apple\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keys_apple-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>When it came to portability, we looked at the size of the keyboard, of course, but also at how rugged they felt and how comfortable we were shoving them into a rucksack. Keyboards are notoriously susceptible to crumbs and other junk getting stuck under the keys, so it\'s important you shield them in your bag.</p><p> In this respect, the KeySonic and Apple will need some form of protection – such as a sleeve – to ensure that dust doesn\'t get anywhere it shouldn\'t. It\'s also worth noting that these two are both (largely) white, so the dirt that they\'ll inevitably come into contact with is more likely to show up on them. </p><p>The Macally, iGo and i-Connex keyboards are all black and generally better designed for flinging quickly into bags without too much care. The first comes with a protective case that doubles as a stand for your device – a really good idea for when you\'re on the road and need to prop up your iPad, iPhone or iPod touch but don\'t want to lug around even more kit. </p><p>Whichever device we plonked into the stand stayed upright firmly (which is more than could be said for some other, achem, stand-alone stands we\'ve tried). And the i-Connex protects itself from dust in your bag by folding in half, though there is still a gap between the two segments where stuff can get in. </p><p>The iGo is probably the best when it comes to portability, though, because its keys are sealed around the edges, so no dust can make its way where it\'s not wanted. Add to this that it\'s the thinnest and lightest package on test here and you\'ve got pretty much the ultimate portable travel companion. </p><p>The only small issue we found was that the rubberised surface on the front and back did attract dust and other unwanted junk, which, while not affecting performance, doesn\'t do much for the aesthetics. </p><p><strong>Test results </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Test 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/test2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong><img alt=\"Keysonic\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Tap/Tap%2005/TAP05.group2.keysonic2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><br /></strong></p><p><strong>KeySonic KSK-3201MacBT - £38 </strong></p><p><strong>Whether it\'s a text, email or thesis you want to type, this little keyboard will be your best friend </strong></p><p>The fact that you\'re considering getting an external keyboard for your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch suggests you\'re having to do a fair bit of typing on it. </p><p>With that in mind, let\'s get one thing clear: go for the very best there is for long-form typing. Your fingers (and stress levels) will thank you. Because of this, we can\'t recommend the Macally, even though we like the stand it comes with. As a keyboard, it\'s simply too small and typing on it produces too many errors. </p><p>Similarly, while we like the full-size main keys on the Freedom i-Connex and its folding design, its unintuitively positioned keys – notably backspace – caused our stress levels to rise considerably while we were using it. Not what you need when you\'re trying to hammer out that essay or meeting plan with only a few minutes spare.</p><p> Indeed, it\'s this irritating moving around of keys that does for the iGo as well – not to mention its omission of the right Shift key – because it\'s otherwise really nice to type on and almost flawless when it comes to portability. </p><p>So with the choice between one keyboard with full-size keys (Apple) and another with smaller ones (KeySonic), you might think that we\'d go for the former, based on how easy it would be to type on. But in practice, we didn\'t find that the smaller keys on the KeySonic hampered us at all. In fact, when it comes to portability, its smaller size and slightly lighter weight are virtues. </p><p>Even if you do plan to use it mainly just sitting at your desk, the smaller footprint leaves you more space for your papers, stationary holders and photos of your nearest and dearest. The other big thing the KeySonic\'s got going for it is its price. It\'s £20 cheaper than the Apple model, but you don\'t feel that you\'re compromising on style or quality. </p><p>Even though it\'s plastic, it still looks the part alongside your iOS device and feels robust and durable.

Even the base models are stacked. The off-the-shelf models come with the blistering Core i5 1.6 (11-inch, £849/£999 depending on memory and SSD) or 1.7 Ghz (13-inch, £1,099/£1,349 depending on memory and SSD) variants. </p><p>Even better is that, for an extra £100 you can pop a 1.8GHz Core i7 into the high-end 13-inch (it\'s £150 to pop it into the high end 11-inch) and that is what is inside the 13-inch MacBook Air Apple has been kind enough to loan us here.

Various Thunderbolt products will launch in due course, but in the meantime Apple has also released a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-announces-new-thunderbolt-led-display-981178\">new Apple Thunderbolt Display</a> which is a thorn in our theory that thunderbolt is just a gimmick. </p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-9-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>You see, the monitor acts as a docking station for the MacBook Air. There\'s Gigabit Ethernet, USB ports and FireWire – and it all connects over the Thunderbolt connection along with the video of course! We have to say, the idea of having Thunderbolt as a single point of docking connectivity is mighty appealing – even if the display is a monstrous £899.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/intel-thunderbolt-in-apple-macbook-pro-explained-931050\">Intel Thunderbolt explained</a></p><p><strong>Which should you choose? </strong></p><p>Although the 13-inch MacBook Air is a lot more usable for most workhorse tasks, the 11-inch MacBook Air is still a highly capable machine for most purposes. The displays remain the same as the last generation, though what they\'re driven by is different.</p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Graphics is now provided by Intel\'s HD 3000 graphics built into the new Core chips rather than the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nvidia\" title=\"Nvidia\">Nvidia</a> <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GeForce\" title=\"GeForce\">GeForce</a> 320M used in the last generation. While Intel\'s Sandy Bridge graphics are fine for most needs, if it\'s supreme graphics performance you want than you need a MacBook Pro. </p><p>In terms of pixels, the 11-inch is a 16:9 1366 × 768 panel, while the 13-inch is 16:10 - 1440 × 900.</p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-6-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>All the memory is solid state as with the last generation, and the 11-inch comes with either 64GB or 128GB while the 13-inch provides either 128GB or 256GB depending on model. You can have up to 4GB of DDR3 memory.</p><p>One of the most annoying things about the last MacBook Air was that a compromise had had to be made about the backlit keyboard – it disappeared to the chagrin of many potential purchasers. Thankfully, it is now well and truly back.</p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-4-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>As you\'d expect from any Apple notebook, there\'s the glass Multi-Touch trackpad that supports Lion\'s multi-touch gestures.</p><p><img alt=\"2011 macbook air review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>There\'s also support for Bluetooth 4.0 should you be interested in that, while you also get the standard Apple webcam (not HD) and an SD card in the 13-inch which was introduced with the last generation.

Let\'s pan the river of rumour for some nuggets of news.</p><p><strong>The Samsung Galaxy Q specs include a 5.3-inch screen</strong></p><p>Details are thin on the ground, but we\'re hearing from Yahoo Korea that the Galaxy Q specifications will include a 5.3-inch Super AMOLED screen. That would make it around an inch larger than existing Galaxy handsets, which is worryingly close to Stupidly Large territory. </p><p>Dell has been here already with the Dell Streak 5, but few other firms seem to think five-inchers are the way forward. Samsung, however, argues that for some people the smartphone is the ideal format and tablets are just too big; the Galaxy Q, it says, will be the ideal stepping stone between PC and mobile phone.</p><p><strong>The Samsung Galaxy Q specifications include a dual core processor</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.t3.com/news/samsung-galaxy-q-to-launch-at-ifa-as-5-3-inch-handset?=58589\">T3 reckons</a> it\'ll have a dual core processor and a slimline form factor too. That\'s not something you\'re likely to lose your shirt betting on.</p><p><strong>Last year\'s Samsung Galaxy Q rumours were unfounded</strong></p><p>A supposed spec sheet for the Galaxy Q was widely <a href=\"http://sammyhub.com/2010/07/26/supposed-galaxy-q-specs-surface/\">circulated last year</a> and is doing the rounds again this week, but the BlackBerry-style device it detailed - complete with 3-inch screen and physical keyboard - doesn\'t seem to have survived. </p><p><strong>Samsung Galaxy Q features include 3G</strong></p><p>It\'s unclear whether the 3G support will be for data only or for voice too, but the Samsung Galaxy Q hardware, we\'re told, includes a 3G radio. US customers will get 4G support too.</p><p><strong>The Samsung Galaxy Q software will be Android</strong></p><p>Of course it will be: all of Samsung\'s other interesting kit is Android powered. We don\'t know which version the Samsung Galaxy Q OS will be, however: will it go the smartphone route with Gingerbread or the tablet route with Honeycomb? Depending on the release date it could even be Android 4.0, aka Ice Cream Sandwich.</p><p><strong>The Samsung Galaxy Q UK release date should be late 2011</strong></p><p>If the unveiling isn\'t until IFA 2011, that\'s September - so Samsung will need to work quickly to get its handsets onto the shelves for the all-important Christmas shopping period. With the launch far off, the Samsung Galaxy Q UK price - surprise! - hasn\'t been announced yet, although we\'d expect similar deals to the existing Galaxy range. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

Follow the money','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/iPad%202%20review/ipad%202%20review-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Another quarter, <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/apple-smashes-20m-iphone-sales-barrier-in-q3-980874\">another set of record-breaking financial results from Apple</a>. Mac sales are up. iPad sales are up. iPhone sales are up. iPod Touch sales are up. If Apple makes it, it\'s making more money from it than ever before.</p><p><p>It\'s just a matter of time before Steve Jobs buys the moon.</p><p>Impressive as they are, though, the headline figures don\'t tell the whole story. Apple\'s figures demonstrate that something interesting is happening in computing. The portables are taking over.</p><p>Mac sales continued to grow this quarter, and laptops accounted for the - sorry - lion\'s share: nearly three-quarters of Macs sold were MacBooks, MacBook Pros or MacBook Airs. That\'s not a huge surprise for a firm whose laptops have always been the main attraction, but what is surprising is that iPads are already outselling those Macs, and every other kind of Mac, by a factor of two to one.</p><p>Factor in Apple\'s staggering iPhone sales and the growing importance of the iPod touch, which now accounts for more than half of all iPod sales, and it\'s clear that Apple is a mobile device firm first and a computer firm second.</p><p><strong>Here comes the future</strong></p><p>The trend we\'re seeing here isn\'t limited to Apple: Google\'s Android continues to do astonishing numbers too. In 2002, the number of PCs in the world reached 1 billion. That took twenty-one years. After just four years, the combined sales of iOS and Android are nearing the half-billion mark already.</p><p>Juniper Research tells me that smartphone shipments were 320 million last year; by 2016, the firm says, tech firms will be shipping a billion smartphones per year. For many people smartphones are already their main internet devices; that trend is only going to continue as such phones get smarter, cheaper and even more popular.</p><p>This isn\'t the end of the PC. Quite the opposite: it\'s the rebirth of the PC. I\'d argue that an app-stuffed iPod touch or Android tablet is more of a personal computer than the desktop PC ever was: instead of demanding you come to them and learn their weird ways, modern devices are instant and effortless. And the PC is learning from that.</p><p>Today\'s launch of OS X Lion will make the Mac more iOS-y, and next year\'s Windows 8 will make desktops and laptops more Windows Phone-y. Factor in the rise of cloud computing and the term PC could mean pretty much anything with a screen.</p><p>Steve Jobs calls it the post-PC era. Maybe that\'s the wrong term. From where I\'m sitting, it looks like we\'re entering the interesting-PC era.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16c9c3fd/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16b41628/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Cthis0Eweek0Es0Ehottest0Ereviews0Eon0Etechradar0E9795150Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Review Roundup: This week\'s hottest reviews on TechRadar</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Gary+Marshall%3A+Forget+fanboyism.+Follow+the+money&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fforget-fanboyism-follow-the-money-981011%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsmobile\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Gary+Marshall%3A+Forget+fanboyism.+Follow+the+money&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fforget-fanboyism-follow-the-money-981011%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsmobile\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108458527322/u/49/f/415081/c/669/s/16c9c3fd/kg/216-221-223-227-239-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108458527322/u/49/f/415081/c/669/s/16c9c3fd/kg/216-221-223-227-239-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/mobile-computing-news/~4/B2xr_P6Xwj8\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/mobile-computing-news/~3/B2xr_P6Xwj8/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/mobile-computing\n',4481,NULL,'2011-07-20 09:00:00'),(117,'In Depth: Android 4.0: what you need to know','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/mobile-computing/images/icecreamsandwich-200-200.jpg\" /><p>We\'ve had <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-phones/phone-and-communications/android-2-3-release-date-when-will-you-get-it-913710\">Android 2.3 Gingerbread</a>. We\'ve had <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/android-3-0-honeycomb-937798/review\">Android 3.0 Honeycomb</a>. Next up: Ice Cream Sandwich, the next version of Google\'s Android operating system. </p><p>Although it\'s possible that Ice Cream Sandwich will be given a lower version number, such as Android 2.4, we think the scale of the upgrade makes it more than a mere point release - so our money\'s on Android 4.0. </p><p>No matter what number Google gives it, the next version of Android brings new features, new hardware and new ways to play with your Android kit.</p><p>Here\'s what you need to know.</p><p><strong>Android 4.0 release date</strong></p><p>Google says the Android 4.0 release date will be around Thanksgiving in the US, which means it should ship just in time for the all-important Christmas shopping binge this year.</p><p><strong>Android 4.0 phones</strong></p><p>Specs for what could be the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/google-nexus-3-specs-detailed-966456\">Google Nexus 3</a> have surfaced courtesy of BGR, revealing a handset with a dual-core 1.2GHz or 1.5GHz OMAP 4460 or Qualcomm Snapdragon processor, a 720p HD display, along with 1080p HD video capture through the 5MP rear-mounted camera.</p><p>Huawei is also claiming that its forthcoming handset the Glory, while shipping with Android 2.2, will be upgradeable to Ice Cream Sandwich when the OS becomes available, according to <a href=\"http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2387327,00.asp\">PCMag.com</a>. It\'s not yet known whether the Glory is headed to the UK, and if it does it\'s likely to be carrier-branded rather than come sporting the Huawei badge.</p><p>Motorola\'s Xoom tablet successor is <a href=\"http://www.fudzilla.com/notebooks/item/23418-motorola-working-on-10-inch-2048-x-1536-tablet\">reportedly being tested</a> – apparently offering up rather nifty specs that include a quad-core processor Nvidia processor and a much higher resolution screen alongside Android 4.0. </p><p><strong>The Android 4.0 OS will be a unified OS</strong></p><p>Say goodbye to Gingerbread for phones and Honeycomb for tablets. Android 4.0 Ice Cream Sandwich will be a single OS for both kinds of devices, with the user interface adapting to suit whichever form factor you throw at it. </p><p>A unified codebase means developers will only need to code their apps once for them to work on Android 4.0 phones and Android 4.0 tablets, and Google will offer a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/google-makes-ice-cream-sandwich-official-954244\">whole bunch of new APIs</a> that developers can use to code apps for every kind of Android 4.0 device.</p><p><strong>The Android 4.0 interface will look a lot like Honeycomb</strong></p><p>Not a huge surprise, this one: the rather whizzy new interface from Honeycomb will be making its way to Android 4.0 - although as with previous incarnations, device manufacturers and/or network operators can create their own customised UIs too. The Android 4.0 UI will enable you to adjust the size of home screen widgets to better suit your particular preferences.</p><p><strong>Android 4.0 specs include USB hosting</strong></p><p>The Android Open Accessory programme brings third-party devices into the Android fold, potentially enabling you to connect anything from an Xbox controller or USB mouse for Android games to a heart monitor for fitness apps. Accessories will initially connect via USB, with Bluetooth coming along shortly afterwards.</p><p><strong>Android 4.0 features include goodies for phone users</strong></p><p>Android 4.0 phone users will get an expanded multitasking tool and a system manager that ensures you don\'t run out of memory. </p><p><strong>Android 4.0 software will track your face</strong></p><p>Your Android 4.0 phone or tablet\'s camera will be doing some potentially nifty facial recognition, tracking the movement of your head and adjusting the on-screen image accordingly to create a pseudo-3D effect. </p><p>Google has also demoed videoconferencing that uses the feature to focus the camera on the person you want to look at, which is fine unless you\'re staring at someone good-looking while talking to somebody who\'s been hit with the ugly stick.</p><p><strong>The Android 4.0 system requirements could be hefty</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/google-nexus-3-specs-detailed-966456\">Leaked details</a> suggest that the Google Nexus 3, Google\'s reference handset, will have a 1.2 or 1.5GHz processor (although some of the more excited rumours predict a quad-core Kal-El processor), 1GB of RAM, a \"monster-sized\" display, 1080p video capture and an ultra-thin body. US customers get 4G mobile internet too.</p><p><strong>Android 4.0 hardware will be relatively future-proof</strong></p><p>Google has persuaded its manufacturing partners to agree that when they make new kit, it\'ll support the latest Android updates for at least eighteen months, and firms such as Samsung promise that they\'ll be dishing out upgrades much more quickly than before. The aim is to prevent embarrassing \"where\'s my upgrade?\" howls from existing and future Android customers.</p><p>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16cc365f/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16da7800/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Ctablet0Esales0Eup0E30A0A0Eyear0Eon0Eyear0E9820A320Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Tablet sales up 300% year on year</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16e6e83c/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Ccurrys0Egets0Esamsung0Egalaxy0Etab0E10A0E10Ehead0Estart0E9829410Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Currys gets Samsung Galaxy Tab 10.1 head start</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16edf083/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Cwindows0Etablets0E80Efeatures0Ewe0Ewant0Eto0Esee0E983540A0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">In Depth: Windows tablets: 8 features we want to see</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16edfb07/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Candroid0E20E30Eupdate0Earrives0Efor0Esamsung0Egalaxy0Etab0E9835870Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Android 2.3 update arrives for Samsung Galaxy Tab</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16ef4029/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Ctablets0Cfirst0Ehtc0Epuccini0Epictures0Eunveiled0E9836880Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Detailed HTC Puccini pictures unveiled</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=In+Depth%3A+Android+4.0%3A+what+you+need+to+know&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fmobile-computing%2Ftablets%2Fandroid-4-0-what-you-need-to-know-968819%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsmobile\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=In+Depth%3A+Android+4.0%3A+what+you+need+to+know&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fmobile-computing%2Ftablets%2Fandroid-4-0-what-you-need-to-know-968819%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsmobile\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/mobile-computing-news/~4/qTkHnrKBGw4\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/mobile-computing-news/~3/qTkHnrKBGw4/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/mobile-computing\n',8161,NULL,'2011-07-20 08:21:00'),(118,'Buying Guide: 10 laptops you can buy for the price of a Chromebook','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/mobile-computing/notebooks-and-tablet-pcs/Samsung/samsung-series-5-200-200.jpg\" /><p>While Samsung\'s <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-chromebook-series-5-970705/review\">Google Chromebook</a> is an interesting piece of tech, it\'s not for everyone. </p><p><p>Its heavily-modified Linux-based operating system may run like Usain Bolt on with the wind behind him, but if you find yourself without an internet connection it\'s a £350 lump of useless plastic. </p><p>And, unless Angry Birds is your cup of tea, you can forget about playing games on it. </p><p>So we\'ve put on our technological Barbour jacket and used our cyberdog to herd 10 of the best Chromebook alternatives into the digital pen of TechRadar. </p><p>They all come in at a similar price, and, as we found, you can get a lot for your money.

This ultraportable sports a brushed-metal finish, as well as an astonishing five hour battery life and a vibrant screen.

This means it\'s a cheap-ish laptop that\'s actually capable of HD movies, light video editing and even a little gaming. What\'s more is that it\'s astonishingly well-built, and features a five hour battery life.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/packard-bell-easynote-ts13-943124/review\">Read our Packard Bell EasyNote TS13 review</a></p><p><strong>3.

This generous amount of memory coupled with a dedicated ATi Mobility Radeon HD 5470 graphics chip means that the laptop is capable of far more than just emails and Angry Birds. In fact, we managed to get Portal 2 running on it. An amazing performer whose only bad point is the slightly tacky build quality.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/hp-pavilion-dv6-3112sa-957695/review\">Read our HP Pavilion DV6-3112sa review</a></p><p><strong>4.

It\'s a solidly built machine, with a luxurious brushed-metal finish that puts it in league with lappies that cost twice the price. Our only minor niggle was the lack of an optical drive, but this sacrifice eans it weighs a meagre 1.9kg.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/acer-aspire-timeline-x-3820tz-950996/review\">Read our Acer Aspire Timeline X 3820TZ review</a></p><p><strong>6.

Performance isn\'t amazing, but what put this Vaio firmly in the four-star category is its ease of use. The keyboard is extremely comfortable, the screen bright and glossy, and it\'s finished with a clean and crisp look. Those extra few inches of screen real estate go a long way, too.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/sony-vaio-vpc-eb3j0e-wi-971647/review\">Read our Sony VAIO VPC-EB3J0E/WI review</a></p><p><strong>7.

Which means: GAMES! Proper modern 3D games with guns and explosions and everything. It\'s also a great all-rounder, and able to handle photo and HD video editing without breaking a sweat. The keyboard could be a bit better, but that\'s the least of your worries when you\'ve got so many Nazi zombies to kill.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/acer-aspire-5742g-971620/review\">Read our Acer Aspire 5742G review</a></p><p><strong>8.

Of course, it\'s never going to be the most portable of laptops, but games and films look absolutely terrific. Unsurprisingly, Toshiba has cut corners on the components to keep the price low, and it\'s littered with a surprising number of junk programs. It\'s still a competent, capable laptop, and just look at the size of that screen! It\'s a whopper!</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/toshiba-satellite-c670d-968755/review\">Read our Toshiba Satellite C670D review</a></p><p><strong>9.

It\'s capable of HD video playback and editing, and it even includes Lenovo\'s VeriFace software, which scans your mug to allow access. The 201-minute battery life, lack of an HDMI port and meagre 250GB hard drive were a bit of a letdown, but overall it\'s a fantastic computing experience. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-g560-937933/review\">Read our Lenovo G560 review</a></p><p><strong>10.

The netbook redefined portable computing, and the Chromebook cribs both its form factor and its original Linux operating system. Asus is still at it, and its latest Eee is a beautiful, powerful netbook packing USB 3.0 and ExpressGate for getting straight on the net. As a netbook should be, it\'s light, with a substantial battery life, and proof that Asus\' four years of experience has paid off.</p><p><a

released an update for the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/tablets/blackberry-playbook-947731/review\">BlackBerry PlayBook</a> OS, bringing some updates to the BlackBerry Bridge app as well as new media features and extra language support. </p><p>The Bridge app allows users to access emails, contacts and calendar info that is held on their BlackBerry smartphones on the PlayBook tablet as well, and the updates are fairly minor – it\'s nothing as exciting as getting your actual emails direct to your actual tablet. </p><p>What you will be able to do, however, is access ZIP files that have been received as an email attachment (by downloading to your phone\'s SD card then extracting the files to your tablet). </p><p><strong>Groundbreaking</strong></p><p>All pictures on the PlayBook, whether taken with the camera or downloaded from elsewhere, can now be viewed in portrait or landscape within the Pictures app, although it seems crazy that this wasn\'t the case to begin with. </p><p>The video app also gets a bit of update love, with the pinch gesture now zooming you into the content even as it plays. </p><p>With OS v1.0.7, BlackBerry PlayBooks can now also handle fifteen new languages, including Czech, Polish, Portuguese Brazilian, Russian, Turkish and Swedish. </p><p>To download the software update, simply tap the notification on the PlayBook\'s status bar, or head to \'software updates\' in the settings menu. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16c5676f/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div

Sky Go review','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/sky%20go%20review/sky%20go%20main-200-200.jpg\" /><p>On paper, the launch of the newly-branded Sky Go service looked rather straight forward.</p><p>Step one: rebrand Sky Player with Sky Go logos. Step two: replace the Sky Mobile TV iOS apps with the new Sky Go apps. Easy.</p><p>However, what actually happened is that with the Sky Go marketing campaign in full swing, the new service went live without any sign of the Sky Go app for iPhone, iPod touch or iPad.</p><p>This predictably incurred the wrath of many existing Sky subscribers who were eager to try out this new \'free\' service they\'d been promised. The apps did briefly go live on the App Store but were immediately pulled down again after \'bugs\' were found. Discontented subscribers raged on the Sky forums as blameless Sky support staff attempted to douse the flames.</p><p>So here we are, several weeks later, and the Sky Go iOS apps are finally up and running. So what\'s the shizzle?</p><p><strong>First look</strong></p><p>Sky Go is available to every single one of Sky\'s 68 squillion subscribers in the UK at no extra cost (or \'free\' as Sky likes to call it), though you\'ll only get access to the channels that you already pay for.</p><p>You can access the service from any PC, Mac, iPhone, iPod touch, iPad or Xbox 360 (Gold subscribers only, and the service is called just \'Sky\'). There are caveats to this, though, in that you can only register two devices per account (down from Sky Player\'s four). The pay-off with this is that you can watch on both these devices at the same time, which wasn\'t possible with Sky Player.</p><p><img alt=\"sky go review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/sky%20go%20review/3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Sky Player veterans will be pleased to hear that the management of registered devices has been improved in Sky Go, too. You\'re given a simple graphic where you can select which of your devices to authorise. There currently doesn\'t appear to be any restrictions on how many times you can swap these registered devices around, though Sky says this is subject to \'fair use\'.</p><p><img alt=\"sky go devices\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/sky%20go%20review/devices-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>You can only manage these devices from a web browser though - you can\'t do it from within the iOS app itself.</p><p><strong>Just like Sky Player</strong></p><p>Sky Go has not exactly undergone a major facelift since the days of Sky Player. When accessed from a home computer, the service is essentially the same. It looks the same, it feels the same and it works the same way.</p><p><img alt=\"sky go review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/sky%20go%20review/4-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>It uses Silverlight rather than Flash and allows you to stream a selected range of channels including: All five Sky Sports channels, Sky One, Sky Living, Sky Atlantic, GOLD, MTV, Sky Arts 1, Sky Movies Premiere, Sky Movies Showcase, Sky Movies Action, Sky Movies Family, Eurosport 1 & 2, ESPN, ESPN Classic, Sky News, Nat Geo, Nat Geo Wild, History, Eden, Crime, Cartoon Network, Boomerang, Nickleodeon, Disney XD, Disney Channel and Nick Jr.</p><p>You can browse channels using the slightly clunky in-browser EPG, or simply flick up and down between channels mid-stream in the same way you would if you were watching normal Sky TV.</p><p><strong>iOS app</strong></p><p><strong><img alt=\"app\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/sky%20go%20review/app-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><br /></strong></p><p>There is a Sky Go Android app in the works, but for the time being Sky subscribers will be limited to iOS devices for their mobile entertainment. The iPad and iPhone app can be downloaded for free from the App store, but offers fewer channels - Sky Sports 1, 2, 3, 4 and News, ESPN, Sky Movies Premiere, Sky Movies Showcase, Sky Movies Action and Sky Movies Family. More channels will appear over time.</p><p><img alt=\"sky go channels\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/sky%20go%20review/IMG_0114-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>When selecting a channel, you are given a preview window at the top of the screen and can expend it if you like the look of what you see. It\'s a slick app, though it did crash on us once (on iPad 2) and is much easier to navigate if you\'ve got a robust internet connection - the EPG is downloaded in one big chunk.</p><p><strong>Picture quality</strong></p><p>The quality of Sky\'s streaming has never been in doubt. It\'s excellent on both a computer and iPad, and looks particularly good when hooking up your computer or Xbox to a television. You can choose several \'quality\' settings depending on your connection speed, though if you choose \'Auto\' it\'ll auto detect the fluctuations in your bandwidth and always give you the maximum picture quality for your line.</p><p><strong>Sky Go over Wi-Fi...</strong><img alt=\"sky go wifi\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/sky%20go%20review/IMG_0124-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Detail is such that when watching a cricket match, for example, there\'s no problem seeing the ball as the frame rate and resolution handle fast-paced action competently.</p><p>3G streaming for iPhone and iPad is possible, though the quality you\'ll get over 3G is almost unwatchable unless your 3G signal is brilliant. Certainly, it looks better on the iPhone than the iPad over 3G due to the smaller screen. Beware it\'ll eat up a lot of data though.</p><p> <strong>Sky Go over 3G...</strong><img alt=\"sky go 3g\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/sky%20go%20review/IMG_0123-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>One disappointing thing for some people will be the fact that you cannot use the Sky Go iPad app in conjunction with the iPad 2\'s HDMI adapter. If you want to watch Sky Go on a TV, you\'ll need to plug in your computer or an Xbox 360, as attempting this with the iPad app delivers a message along the lines of \'ha, nice try sucker\'. </p><p><strong>Non-Sky subscribers</strong></p><p>If you don\'t subscribe to Sky but want to sign up for Sky Go, you will be able to do so from August. Prices will start at £15 though if you want those sports channels you\'ll be asked to pay closer to £40 a month.</p><p><strong>Offline watching</strong></p><p>As with Sky Player before it, there\'s also a Desktop app available for downloading on-demand content. So if you watch to catch up on a show or match you missed, you can use the desktop app to download it.</p><p>It\'s a decent service, though nowhere near as polished as the BBC iPlayer app and not as easy to use. The iOS apps only support direct streaming though, so there\'s no downloading Sky programming to your gadgets.</p><p>In conclusion then, it\'s a decent service and one that will please all of the current Sky subscribers who want to make use of it. Making Sky Go \'free\' to all current subscribers is a move that will no doubt keep the monthly fees pouring in and is, frankly, a nice touch at a time when cash, for many people, is rather hard to come by.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16c54496/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16c5e231/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Claptops0C10A0Elaptops0Eyou0Ecan0Ebuy0Efor0Ethe0Eprice0Eof0Ea0Echromebook0E980A7440Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: 10 laptops you can buy for the price of a Chromebook</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415081/s/16ed15de/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cmobile0Ecomputing0Claptops0C10A0Ebest0Elaptops0Efor0Estudents0E9833850Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsmobile/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: 10 best laptops for students</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Hands+on%3A+Sky+Go+review&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fmobile-computing%2Ftablets%2Fhands-on-sky-go-review-980698%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsmobile\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Hands+on%3A+Sky+Go+review&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fmobile-computing%2Ftablets%2Fhands-on-sky-go-review-980698%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsmobile\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108458580472/u/49/f/415081/c/669/s/16c54496/kg/201-216-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108458580472/u/49/f/415081/c/669/s/16c54496/kg/201-216-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/mobile-computing-news/~4/p-c2k5u0CjI\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/mobile-computing-news/~3/p-c2k5u0CjI/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/mobile-computing\n',9204,NULL,'2011-07-19 14:00:00'),(121,'EA boss shifts strategy to embrace mobile and social','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/images/EA_logo-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Following announcements of a narrower-than-expected loss for the last financial quarter, EA boss John Riccitiello said that mobile and social gaming, alongside new motion-control tech, is fundamentally changing the nature of games publishing and that EA is shifting its publishing strategy to reflect these changes.</p><p>Speaking on a conference call in which EA reported decent financial gains for its first fiscal quarter (the quarter ending June 30), with decent sales of both digital and packaged games resulting in slightly better-than-expected revenues, Riccitiello outlined his company\'s new focus on digital and social gaming.</p><p><strong>iPad and Android gaming</strong></p><p>\"Most of us recognize that the industry has radically changed and the pace of change has altered dramatically,\" said Riccitiello. \"Eighteen months ago there was no iPad. Google was just experimenting with Android. Most games were a single-revenue opportunity.</p><p>\"We intend to finish this fiscal year a much different company than when we started,\" Riccitiello said.</p><p>The EA boss stressed that motion-sensing games and the boom in mobile apps were both changing the very fabric of videogame development and publishing, which means that EA now thinks of its game launches as \"year round events\" as opposed to those one-off bing-bang launches in the past.</p><p>The big news that wasn\'t forthcoming from this week\'s conference call was the fact that there are no new details to share on the forthcoming MMO <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic</em>, so we hope to hear a lot more about that particular title from Gamescom in Germany next month.</p><p>EA Sports head honcho Peter Moore noted that the forthcoming <em>FIFA 12</em> will launch on a total of 12 different gaming platforms later this year. Moore also revealed that the average revenue to EA of a paying gamer on Facebook is $56 per annum.</p><p>With an impressive array of big hitters coming up later this year, including <em>Star Wars: The Old Republic, Battlefield 3, FIFA 12, Madden NFL 12</em>, as well as new versions of <em>The Sims</em> on social platforms and its new Origin digital game distribution store, EA looks like it is set for yet another lucrative year in gaming. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16f3c569/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16d1f104/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Camazon0Egame0Edownload0Estore0Eto0Ereach0Ethe0Euk0Ein0Eoctober0E0E9815650Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Amazon Game Download Store to reach the UK in October?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16e767f9/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cid0Esoftware0Eon0Ethe0Efuture0Eof0Emobile0Egaming0E9829640Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">id Software on the future of mobile gaming</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16e8a61b/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cnintendo0E3ds0Epulled0Efrom0Eamazon0E9830A580Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Nintendo 3DS pulled from Amazon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16ec0bc3/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Csony0Ereveals0Eps0Evita0Es0Eonline0Eand0Esocial0Efeatures0E9833160Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Sony reveals PS Vita\'s online and social features</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16eee8f5/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cmicrosoft0Ereleases0Enew0Exbox0E360A0Eheadset0Eand0Eremote0E9836520Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Microsoft releases new Xbox 360 headset and remote</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=EA+boss+shifts+strategy+to+embrace+mobile+and+social&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fgaming%2Fea-boss-shifts-strategy-to-embrace-mobile-and-social-984051%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsgaming\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=EA+boss+shifts+strategy+to+embrace+mobile+and+social&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fgaming%2Fea-boss-shifts-strategy-to-embrace-mobile-and-social-984051%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsgaming\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108878055297/u/49/f/415077/c/669/s/16f3c569/kg/221-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108878055297/u/49/f/415077/c/669/s/16f3c569/kg/221-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/gaming-news/~4/QYUam5fEsDM\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/gaming-news/~3/QYUam5fEsDM/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/gaming\n',5023,NULL,'2011-07-27 09:38:00'),(122,'Microsoft releases new Xbox 360 headset and remote','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/images/Xbox%20headset-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Microsoft has announced a new Xbox 360 Bluetooth headset and Media Remote Control this week, due for commercial release this coming November.</p><p>Microsoft\'s new wireless Bluetooth headset and Media Remote will no doubt appeal to those Xbox gamers that like to play online via Xbox Live or who like to use their games console as a media centre to watch movies, TV and listen to their favourite tunes.</p><p><strong>Taking communication to the next level</strong></p><p>Both products will be available this coming November, with the wireless headset carrying an estimated retail price of $59.99 (£36.63) in the US and the remote $19.99 (£12.20).

This is fairly cool because it exposes users to games they might not have heard of and you can see how popular those games are and how people are rating them.\"</p><p>Near\'s gifts also follow the player around as you \"go about your daily life\", with a planned limit of 100KB gift box per game. </p><p><strong>LiveArea updates and Party mode</strong></p><p>Sony\'s LiveArea system will show players new notifications from their mates, new downloadable content that is available alongside any new updates for the games that they have on their PS Vita. </p><p>PS Vita\'s Party mode is a voice-chat system that lets you chat with all of your online mates, no matter what games you or they happen to be playing at any given time.</p><p>Party is \"really good for having friends together to discuss games, chat about them and get into them\", Rogers declared. </p><p>As on Xbox Live, Party is \"platform-wide\" and allows you and three friends to form a party that sticks together regardless of what you do on Vita. \"You can chat across games through text and voice,\" explained Rogers. </p><p>\"You can have different Party groups for different games or genres,\" Sony\'s Rogers explained. \"Maybe you\'ve got a first-person shooter group that you can all chat and go into. </p><p>\"The voice chat part you can override, so if in-game you\'ve got your own teams for audio then you can override the Party chat and turn that off.\" </p><p>Finally, PS Vita\'s Activity feature is a way for players to discuss their in-game progress with their online mates.</p><p>\"The system automatically puts a few activities in there, that encourages people to then comment similar to Facebook style,\" said Rogers, adding that Sony hopes publishers will use it sensibly and not spam users unnecessarily. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16ec0bc3/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16d1f104/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Camazon0Egame0Edownload0Estore0Eto0Ereach0Ethe0Euk0Ein0Eoctober0E0E9815650Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Amazon Game Download Store to reach the UK in October?</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16e767f9/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cid0Esoftware0Eon0Ethe0Efuture0Eof0Emobile0Egaming0E9829640Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">id Software on the future of mobile gaming</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16e8a61b/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cnintendo0E3ds0Epulled0Efrom0Eamazon0E9830A580Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Nintendo 3DS pulled from Amazon</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16eee8f5/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cmicrosoft0Ereleases0Enew0Exbox0E360A0Eheadset0Eand0Eremote0E9836520Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Microsoft releases new Xbox 360 headset and remote</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16f3c569/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cea0Eboss0Eshifts0Estrategy0Eto0Eembrace0Emobile0Eand0Esocial0E9840A510Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">EA boss shifts strategy to embrace mobile and social</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Sony+reveals+PS+Vita%27s+online+and+social+features&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fgaming%2Fsony-reveals-ps-vita-s-online-and-social-features-983316%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsgaming\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Sony+reveals+PS+Vita%27s+online+and+social+features&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fgaming%2Fsony-reveals-ps-vita-s-online-and-social-features-983316%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsgaming\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877738842/u/49/f/415077/c/669/s/16ec0bc3/kg/253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877738842/u/49/f/415077/c/669/s/16ec0bc3/kg/253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/gaming-news/~4/Zk2RTNH__eQ\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/gaming-news/~3/Zk2RTNH__eQ/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/gaming\n',5466,NULL,'2011-07-26 07:53:00'),(124,'Microsoft launches Avatar Kinect on Xbox Live','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/games/xbox/xbox360/images/Avatar_Kinect_kids_art_11-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Microsoft has launched Avatar Kinect -

future of mobile gaming','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/Mobile%20Phones/iPhone/rage_iphone-200-200.jpg\" /><p>John Carmack, one of the most innovative and tech-savvy games designers of our generation, thinks that mobile smartphone gaming is the future.</p><p>Carmack has recently released the critically-acclaimed <a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/259773/rage-confirmed-for-iphone/\"><em>Rage</em> </a>for iPad and iPhone and iPod touch, a game that has caused many gamers and hardcore games developers to take a long, hard look at the potential of \"proper\" games on iOS devices.</p><p>The overwhelmingly positive response to Carmack\'s first iOS game from QuakeCon last year clearly shows that there is a market for proper non-casual games amongst adult smartphone owners.</p><p><strong>Rage on mobile</strong></p><p>Jason Kim, producer on the forthcoming PC and console version of id\'s<em> Rage </em>– out this coming October – told CVG recently that Carmack knocked the iOS version of the game together in almost no time.</p><p>\"It\'s really been interesting to see our mobile development team work on that compartmentalised piece of Rage content,\" Kim told CVG.</p><p>\"It\'s another one of those great things working at id with John Carmack and those guys that are able to take some idea and turn it into a whole product that people can actually play and get in their hands.<br /> <br /> \"John went away and literally in a couple of weeks, came back with an engine that works on the iPhone,\" he added</p><p>\"When he was walking around the office with it working on the iPhone, he would show it to people and their jaws were dropping like, \'Oh my God is that running on iPhone? Is that real time or is that a video?\'</p><p>\"He was moving things around in real time and this is just him going off and making something that runs on a little mobile device. </p><p>\"That\'s him being able to analyse the hardware and understanding how to create rendering technology and maximises the opportunities within that piece of hardware and what he can program to make it work.</p><p><strong>More to be done</strong></p><p>Kim continued: \"I think there\'s a lot more that could be done there but we don\'t have it all planned out, it\'s actually nice not to know how different things are going to be. Mobile devices are changing very quickly, some people are changing their phones every year. </p><p>I think it depends on what really happens with these mobile devices, what happens on the Apple Store, how Android works and what kind of store front they have and how popular those apps become.</p><p>\"There are so many different ways that this could go and it\'s not totally clear to us but we put something out there and I think it\'s done really well for us. It\'s a foray into uncharted territory and it begins with John saying, \'I want to get a game working on that little device\'.\'\"</p><p>See the <a

Xbox 360 will cost around £349.99, with the geektastic console bringing custom sound effects, a 320GB hard drive and a bundle that includes the Star Wars Kinect game, a Kinect sensor and Kinect Adventures. </p><p>The Star Wars edition Xbox 360 is certainly likely to appeal to the legion of fans of both the film and gaming, with the box decked out like R2-D2 and the controller given a C-3PO makeover.</p><p>The kit does come at a premium, however, with the £350 price tag the highest SKU for Xbox – £50 dearer than the RRP for the 250Gb Kinect bundle. </p><p><strong>Xbox-wing</strong></p><p>But, with Star Wars noises at startup and when you eject a disc, this might well be the talking point the discerning <em>Star Wars</em> fan has been looking for in his living room. </p><p>The bad news is that when the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy finally arrives on Blu-ray, they are going to have to fork out for a Blu-ray player (or a PS3) to play them on, because Xbox is DVD only. </p><p>We have no news on a Star Wars Xbox 360 UK release date, but it won\'t be a long time ago or in a land far, far away. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

I have to say, what we\'ve done in the R&amp;D projects has just been fantastic.\"</p><p>When asked whether he thought virtual reality could make a resurgence – and presumably shake off the horror that was <em>The Lawnmower Man</em> – Hocking explained: \"Yeah it could be, it certainly seems possible, and these head-mounted displays incorporate 3D tech.

It\'s quite another to find out that Microsoft is gearing up to build one.</p><p><p>Recent <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/microsoft-looking-for-engineers-for-next-xbox-934273\">job postings</a> reveal that the Xbox Console Architecture team is hunting for new blood. Successful candidates will join a team that will be \"responsible for defining and delivering next generation console architectures from conception through implementation.\"</p><p>It screams Xbox 720 (or whatever Microsoft chooses to call its new Xbox). So let\'s gather together the facts, the half-whispered untruths and the wishful thinking to see what such a machine might be like… </p><p><strong>The Xbox 720 specs will be a significant technological leap forward</strong></p><p>The Xbox 360 was launched in 2005, with the best technology that 2004 had to offer. Inside, it used a custom-made IBM Power PC with a trio of 3.2GHz cores and an ATI graphics processor. </p><p>Compare this ageing specification to a 2011 PC like the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-mac-desktops/scan-3xs-vengeance-917708/review\">Scan 3XS Vengeance</a>. It rocks the latest Core i7-2600K Sandy Bridge CPU, Nvidia GTX 580 graphics card, 1TB of onboard storage and 8GB of DDR3. </p><p>Cevat Yerli, the boss at Crytek, believes that the PC is effectively a generation ahead of the Xbox 360 and PS3. \"As long as the current console generation exists and as long as we keep pushing the PC as well, the more difficult it will be to really get the benefit of both,\" <a href=\"http://www.next-gen.biz/features/building-a-new-pc\">Yerli spilled to Edge</a>.</p><p>Something has got to give.</p><p><strong>Xbox 720 storage and disc format<br /></strong></p><p>Cloud storage? We might not be ready to abandon physical media just yet. But Steam has served PC users well for several years and OnLive is turning heads. </p><p>The most obvious next-gen storage option for the next Xbox is Blu-ray. But Microsoft has refused to add it to the existing Xbox 360. Other alternatives? You\'ll find flag-wavers for flash drives, Nintendo-style game cartridges, even <a href=\"http://www.cheapassgamer.com/forums/blog.php?b=19774\">the resurrection of HD-DVD</a>. </p><p><strong>Xbox 720 processor and graphics</strong></p><p>Considering that the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/gaming/games-consoles/microsoft-xbox-360-250gb-703247/review\">Xbox 360 Slim</a> now features a \'Vejle\' CPU/GPU combo processor, KitGuru ponders the possibility of the new Xbox 720 getting <a href=\"http://www.kitguru.net/software/gaming/jules/microsoft-chooses-amd-fusion-ii-for-xbox-720/\">a cutting-edge AMD Fusion chip</a>. It\'s betting on the DX11-capable Krishna APU (Accelerated Processing Unit), due for release late 2012.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/amd-xbox-720-graphics-will-equal-avatar--980233\">AMD reckons</a> it will be a beast of a machine, pumping out graphics that offer <em>Avatar</em>-levels of detail. James Cameron\'s opus used <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/cameron-avatar-cgi-was-bigger-than-3d-for-me-905227\">CGI and 3D capturing</a>, with each minute of footage costing $1 million to make. Not only will the console be capable of <em>Avatar</em>-style graphics, according to Neal Robison, AMD\'s director of ISV relationships, it will also feature improved artificial intelligence and physics capabilities. </p><p>This could mean that each individual incidental character – like the pedestrians in <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>, for example – could each take on their own individual personality. </p><p>The \'bigger, better, more\' ethic is what makes the games industry tick. Eat Sleep Play founder David Jaffe suggests we desperately need a new generation of high-end consoles to keep producing \'blockbuster\' games like <em>Battlefield 3, Crysis 2</em> and <em>LA Noire</em>. \"Gameplay travels very easily,\" <a href=\"http://uk.ps3.ign.com/articles/115/1155383p3.html\">Jaffe told IGN</a>. \"The spectacle doesn\'t.\"</p><p><a href=\"http://www.oxm.co.uk/26286/news/ea-xbox-360-has-a-lot-of-untapped-horsepower/\">EA\'s Frank Gibeau disagrees</a>. \"Obviously, more computing horsepower is nice, but to be honest, the Xbox 360 and PS3 still have a lot of horsepower that hasn\'t been tapped.\"</p><p>Epic\'s Mark Rein suggests that a tablet might be the shape of consoles to come. \"Imagine a future Xbox 360 that is actually a tablet you carry around,\" <a href=\"http://www.develop-online.net/news/36015/Epic-boss-sees-next-gen-consoles-going-mobile\">Rein told Develop</a> last year. \"It will have more power than 360 does today, with technology like Kinect built right in…\"</p><p><strong>What about the Xbox 720 controller?</strong></p><p>Love it/hate it, gesture-control is here to stay. Expect an improved version of Microsoft\'s Kinect hardware to be a prominent feature of any new Xbox. Kinect is currently the world\'s \"fastest selling consumer electronics device\" with <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/kinect-sales-top-10-million-934658\">sales topping 10 million</a>. A Guinness World Record.</p><p>But the game pad will remain the input device of choice for veteran gamers. We can\'t imagine playing <em>Gears of War 4</em> by waving our arms around. It lacks precision.</p><p><strong>Could the next Xbox run Windows 8?</strong></p><p>Microsoft wants to create an ecosystem of apps and games that work between Windows Phone, Windows and the next Xbox. But could that mean the new gaming console could run a variant of <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/windows-8-everything-you-need-to-know-701764\">Windows 8</a> <a href=\"http://gamerant.com/xbox-720-windows-operating-system-riley-95925/\">as Gamerant suggests</a>?</p><p><strong>The Xbox 720 release date is 2013. Or 2014. Or 2015…</strong></p><p>Microsoft has said publically that the Xbox 360 will have (at least) <a href=\"http://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/360-to-match-ps3s-10-year-lifecycle-says-kim\">a 10-year life lifespan</a> to match the PS3. That puts a new Xbox launch into 2015…</p><p>Senior execs for a big US retailer <a href=\"http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/13471/retailer-720-and-ps4-not-out-til-2014\">told their shareholders</a> in July 2011 that they don\'t expect the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/xbox-720-every-rumour-about-the-next-xbox-937167\">Xbox 720</a> and PlayStation 4 until 2014.</p><p>Crytek CEO Cevat Yerli feels that we\'re due a \"<a href=\"http://www.computerandvideogames.com/285248/news/crytek-expects-next-gen-consoles-by-2013/\">new [console] generation in 2012, 2013</a>.\" While M2 senior analyst Billy Pidgeon told NowGamer that, while he expects a Wii 2 to surface by 2012, he\'s \"<a href=\"http://www.nowgamer.com/news/5312/wii-2-to-launch-before-new-xbox\">not expecting a next generation Xbox before Q4 2014</a>.\"</p><p>The 2014-2015 timescale looks a good bet. Square Enix is already anticipating the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/xbox-720-every-rumour-about-the-next-xbox-937167\">Xbox 720</a> by planning to open a second Canadian development studio by 2012. \"The new consoles from Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo will require more attention and more staff,\" <a href=\"http://lapresseaffaires.cyberpresse.ca/economie/technologie/201103/16/01-4379927-square-enix-pourrait-ouvrir-un-nouveau-studio-a-montreal.php\">said Stéphane d\'Astous</a>. \"We want to prepare ourselves.\"</p><p>Backing this up is a comment made by a designer who has worked with Microsoft, who implied that a new Xbox 2015 release date is set. In his online portfolio, Ben Peterson wrote \"Microsoft Xbox. Confidential / Collaboration with Microsoft\'s IEB design group investigating future user experiences and hardware for 2015.\"</p><p>Alongside an angled image that doesn\'t give much away, he wrote: \"Microsoft Xbox. Confidential / Collaboration with Microsoft\'s IEB design group investigating future user experiences and hardware for 2015. *Work samples only permissible in person.* (March 2011).\" </p><p>Question marks hang over such information; who is Ben Peterson? Didn\'t he sign an NDA when working with Microsoft? Why is there no contact information on his online portfolio? Will he be allowed to live after such a faux-pas? Or is this all a traffic-mongering lie? </p><p><strong>But the next Xbox could be showcased at E3 2012</strong></p><p>The successor to Microsoft\'s Xbox 360 console is <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/report-xbox-720-to-be-unveiled-at-e3-2012-965933\">likely to be unveiled at E3 2012</a>, according to a \"high-ranking source at Crytek\". They said that <em>TimeSplitters 4</em> is being developed for the next-generation console, using Mircosoft\'s updated DX11 development tool.

rumours: what you need to know about the PlayStation 4','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/home-entertainment/digital-home/images/Sony/sony-plans-2-200-200.jpg\" /><p>When it comes to rumours about the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/xbox-720-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-937167\">next Xbox</a>, there\'s some wild speculation to get your teeth into.</p><p>But on the PlayStation 4 rumour mill, things were, until recently, turning much slower. As Kaz Hirai said earlier in the year: \"we\'re not deliberating on a PS4 or a next generation machine, whatever you call it.\"</p><p>But on 26 May 2011, that stance appeared to change when Sony\'s executive vice president and chief financial officer Masaru Kato seemingly confirmed that Sony is working on the PS4. The revelation took place during a conference call to investors where he was asked about increased R&amp;D costs. </p><p>\"This is a platform business, so for the future platform - when we\'ll be introducing what product I cannot discuss that - but our development work is already under way, so the costs are incurred there,\" <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/playstation-4-development-confirmed-by-sony-959658\">Eurogamer reported him as saying</a>. </p><p>However, in an <a href=\"http://blogs.wsj.com/digits/2011/05/31/sony-cfo-i-never-talked-about-ps4/\">interview with the Wall Street Journal</a> on 31 May 2011, Kato denied that he was specifically referring to the PS4, saying \"Some people misread what I said.\"</p><p>So what can we expect from the PlayStation 4?</p><p><strong>The PS4 specs could abandon the Cell processor and return to x86… </strong></p><p>In February, there were rumours of a <a href=\"http://pc.watch.impress.co.jp/docs/column/kaigai/20110210_425921.html\">failed Sony/IBM research project</a> to develop a PowerPC chip for future PlayStations. Going forward, Sony will surely stick with the advanced, multi-core, bitch-to-develop-for Cell processor that it dropped $3 billion on. Here are three reasons why:</p><p>1. Easy backwards compatibility with the PlayStation 3</p><p>2. A familiar development environment. By 2015 (or whenever a PS4 comes out), games developers will have had much more experience working with Cell and its software tools</p><p>3. Toshiba recently sold its Cell factory in Nagasaki back to Sony for £400 million. Sony is hardly going to abandon the chip now it owns the means to manufacture it in bulk</p><p><strong>What are the PS4 features we\'d most like to see?</strong></p><p>PS4info dreams of a next-gen PlayStation with a <a href=\"http://ps4info.com/2011/01/12/ps4-cpu-vs-ps3-cpu/\">32nm Cell processor an up to 16 SPEs</a>, double the number in the PlayStation 3. While over on gamrConnect, there\'s talk of <a href=\"http://gamrconnect.vgchartz.com/thread.php?id=123649\">a greater partnership with Google</a>. Sony\'s new fondness for Android on the Xperia Play is an interesting strategy.</p><p>Blu-ray on the PlayStation 4 is a dead cert. While digital distribution is undoubtedly the way forward, not every PlayStation owner has access to a fast broadband connection. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.develop-online.net/news/35717/Hirai-Digital-era-over-ten-years-away\">As Kaz Hirai told Develop</a>, \"we do business in parts of the world where network infrastructure isn\'t as robust as one would hope. There\'s always going to be requirement for a business of our size and scope to have a physical medium.\"</p><p>As for the PlayStation 4 controller, Dr. Richard Marks (Sony Computer Entertainment\'s US R&amp;D manager of special projects) says that \"anything that lets us get the player\'s intent into the system more\" is technology they\'ll be looking at. <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/gaming-should-not-go-the-way-of-the-jedi-says-ps-move-man-936467\">No brain wave gaming just yet</a>.</p><p><strong>Could there be a redesign of the PlayStation network too?</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.reghardware.com/2011/07/05/sony_set_to_redesign_playstation_network/\">According to Reg Hardware</a>, Sony has a PlayStation Network design upgrade in the works to compete with Xbox Live - could it eventually launch alongside the PS4?</p><p><strong>What about a PS4 release date?</strong></p><p>Tricky. If you side with the likes of <a href=\"http://www.itproportal.com/2011/02/23/why-sony-holding-back-playstation-4-gaming-console/\">ITProPortal</a>, you might believe that \"the whole concept of a single lounge-bound gaming device may become obsolete\". The future of gaming may well lie in a more portable device/controller that you can play on the move or plug into your TV. Epic\'s Mark Rein has some interesting thoughts on this <a href=\"http://www.develop-online.net/news/36015/Epic-boss-sees-next-gen-consoles-going-mobile\">here</a>. </p><p>Sony claims that the PS3 will have a 10 year lifecycle, suggesting the next PlayStation will arrive by the end of 2016 at the latest. Or we might not get a PlayStation 4 at all. Developers haven\'t yet maxed out the potential of the PS3, while the release of PlayStation Move has given it an extra dimension…</p><p>Senior execs for a big US retailer <a href=\"http://www.strategyinformer.com/news/13471/retailer-720-and-ps4-not-out-til-2014\">told their shareholders</a> that they don\'t expect the Xbox 720 and PlayStation 4 til 2014.</p><p>However, <a href=\"http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20110704PD202.html\">according to Digitimes</a>, Sony is to start production of PS4 at the end of 2011 with Kinect-like body control. Though we\'re not sure how accurate that can possibly be. </p><p>\"Where we go after this is an interesting one,\" <a href=\"http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/gamesblog/2011/mar/15/bafta-interviews-part-two\">says Sony Computer Entertainment UK boss Ray Maguire</a>. \"The online side is very interesting and is a big part of our business going forward. But in terms of what sort of technology we\'ll be using, it\'s far too early to say yet because we\'re only half way through the lifecycle of PS3 - there are many years to come on that machine.\"</p><p>Long live PlayStation 3.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16950158/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16be6ef8/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cconsoles0Camd0Exbox0E720A0Egraphics0Ewill0Eequal0Eavatar0E0E980A2330Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">AMD: \'Xbox 720 graphics will equal Avatar\'</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16d4ca17/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cconsoles0Cr2d20Ec3po0Ethemed0Ekinect0Estar0Ewars0Exbox0E360A0Econsole0Eunveiled0E9817190Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">R2D2/C3PO-themed Kinect Star Wars Xbox 360 console unveiled</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16d8d269/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cconsoles0Cvideo0Ewhat0Ewe0Ed0Elike0Eto0Esee0Ein0Ethe0Exbox0E720A0E9818920Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Video: What we\'d like to see in the Xbox 720</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16e67468/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cconsoles0Cstar0Ewars0Exbox0E360A0Egiven0Euk0Eprice0Eof0E350A0E9828650Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Star Wars Xbox 360 given UK price of £350</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415077/s/16ebcf24/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cgaming0Cconsoles0Cmicrosoft0Elaunches0Eavatar0Ekinect0Eon0Exbox0Elive0E98330A70Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsgaming/story01.htm\">Microsoft launches Avatar Kinect on Xbox Live</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Updated%3A+PS4+rumours%3A+what+you+need+to+know+about+the+PlayStation+4&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fgaming%2Fconsoles%2Fps4-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-playstation-4-937822%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsgaming\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Updated%3A+PS4+rumours%3A+what+you+need+to+know+about+the+PlayStation+4&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fgaming%2Fconsoles%2Fps4-rumours-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-playstation-4-937822%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsgaming\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106217322125/u/49/f/415077/c/669/s/16950158/kg/219-221-253-259/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106217322125/u/49/f/415077/c/669/s/16950158/kg/219-221-253-259/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/gaming-news/~4/Xp8vYL9Pqzk\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/gaming-news/~3/Xp8vYL9Pqzk/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/gaming\n',8890,NULL,'2011-07-11 15:29:00'),(143,'Updated: Wii U: all the latest details','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/games-consoles/images/wii2_official_review_w500-200-200.jpg\" /><p>As original Nintendo Wiis gathered dust in households across the UK, Nintendo confirmed it would unveil a second-generation \'Wii 2\' at this year\'s E3.</p><p>And <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/hands-on-nintendo-wii-u-963320\">now the Wii U</a> is out in the open and we\'ve rounded up all the new details on the new console right here.

Many people laughed and said it would never catch on. It did. Nintendo is hoping that Wii U will capture people\'s imaginations in the same way.</p><p>\"You might remember how the Wii name began to make perfect sense once you started hearing it as Wii. It was clear how much fun we all had playing together,\" said Nintendo of America boss Reggie Fils-Aime on the E3 stage earlier today.</p><p>\"But in thinking about a new Nintendo system we knew the prevailing thought would be this: yes, the game would probably be right for all of us, but could it also be a perfect fit just for you.</p><p>\"The answer to that question is an emphatic \'absolutely\'. Today, welcome to the world of Wii U.\"</p><p>Wii U is the Wii logo we all know well, with a small blue U just to the right of it. It looks (and sounds) a bit weird, but we may well get used to it in time. So here\'s the new console - read on for more details on it and the revolutionary new controller.</p><p><img alt=\"Wii u\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/images/wii-u-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Wii U UK release date</strong></p><p>The Nintendo Wii U UK release date is pencilled in for April 2012.</p><p><strong>Wii U UK price</strong></p><p>Pricing is yet to be announced. But the fear is that, with the new controller, it may be a little too high.</p><p><strong>Wii U is a Full HD, 1080p console</strong></p><p>The new console will be fully HD compatible, unlike its predecessor.</p><p>EA boss John Riccitiello says that Wii U is a \"stunning breakthrough\" that \"speaks directly to EA Sports games\" and boasts \"brilliant HD graphics.\"</p><p>\"Imagine a shooter like <em>Battlefield </em>with jaw-dropping graphics and smooth animations from the Frostbite engine, brought to you on a Nintendo system with that brilliant controller… We can\'t wait to see EA games on this new system.\"</p><p><strong>Wii U has a touchscreen controller</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/nintendo-wii-u-controller-features-6-2-inch-touchscreen-963314\">The controller for the Wii U</a> is, as was rumoured a 6.2-inch touchscreen tablet that also features an accelerometer and gyroscope for motion control, dual analogue sticks, rumble feedback, a D-pad, a front-facing camera, triggers and shoulder buttons, start/select/home buttons and a microphone.</p><p>Each Wii U console will come with a new controller and can also use up to four additional Wii Remote or Wii Remote Plus controllers. The system is also backward compatible, and can play all Wii games and use all Wii accessories.</p><p>Can Nintendo disrupt the market - just as they did with the original Wii controller - yet again?</p><p><img alt=\"Wii u\" src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/E32011/Wii%20U-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Wii U processor <br /></strong></p><p>According to <a href=\"http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/photo/34681.wss\">IBM</a>, Nintendo\'s Wii U is powered by a custom 45nm multi-core Power processor with embedded DRAM. </p><p>Says the company: \"IBM\'s embedded dynamic random access memory will help deliver a thrilling new game experience to Nintendo fans. The new memory technology, a key element of the new Power microprocessor that IBM is building for the Nintendo Wii U console, can triple the amount of memory contained on a single chip, making for extreme game play.\"</p><p><strong>Wii U graphics<br /></strong></p><p>Wii U\'s graphics carry on the ATI heritage of the Wii, with a custom AMD Radeon HD GPU <a href=\"http://kotaku.com/5809767/amd-is-making-the-gpu-under-the-wii-us-hood\">reports Kotaku</a>. </p><p><strong>Wii U specifications and connectivity<br /></strong></p><p>It appears the original Wii\'s Gamecube controller compatibility will be binned. while there will be four USB ports under that hatch/at the rear and there will still be an SD card slot. There will also be some internal storage, though you\'ll be able to boost that by plugging in an external drive. And, as befits an HD console, there will be HDMI onboard, in addition to S-Video and component. Also expect 802.11n Wi-Fi. </p><p><strong>Wii U disc format</strong></p><p>We know Wii U will be backward compatible with all past Wii games, but we don\'t know for sure if there will be any upscaling - or indeed whether the unit will boast a Blu-ray or DVD drive. </p><p>However, <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/nintendo-wii-u-proprietary-discs-store-25gb-of-data-963555\">a company exec has revealed</a> that the system\'s proprietary disc format will hold up to 25GB of data, but it will not be compatible with Blu-ray. A mid-June 2011 report says that the Wii U\'s disc format won\'t be comp</p><p><strong>You can play games solely on the Wii U touchscreen controller</strong></p><p>Nintendo president Satoru Iwata agrees that the first Wii U demo video \"may have answered some questions, but it probably raised several others, too\".</p><p>But the key concept is clear - Nintendo hopes that you will be able to transfer the game you are playing on a TV screen in your home to the local screen, should you wish to play alone in your bedroom or study - perhaps if someone else needs the TV.</p><p>\"Up until now, home console games had to occupy the TV screen in order to be played. But, the new controller for Wii U with 6.2-inch screen means you won\'t need to give up your gameplay when someone else comes in the room and wants to watch a TV programme.\"</p><p><img alt=\"Wii u\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/E32011/Wii_U_Controller_Close-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Demos show that you can move your game from the TV to the screen in your hand almost immediately.</p><p>Games can also make use of both screens - there\'s an ace video of this in action where a girl is using the controller as the tee in a golf game while using a standard Wiimote to actually swing - it\'s at 3m30s.</p><p>     <p>Here\'s a pic of the controller in use for baseball:</p><p><img alt=\"Wii u\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/E32011/Wii_U_Controller_Aiming-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>So in single-player games the new controller can display information on its screen that does not appear on the TV, while the information and viewpoint can also change in the new controller based on the orientation of its gyroscope.</p><p>In multiplayer games the player using the new controller can have a different experience than those looking at the TV.</p><p><strong>Wii U does video calling and more</strong></p><p>It also looks like you will be able to make video-calls on the Wii U control pad, using its front-facing camera. Plus, you will be able to share content such as your holiday pictures and home videos from your local controller to the main television with ease.</p><p><strong>Wii U is fully backward compatible with kit and games</strong></p><p>Wii U is fully backward compatible, which means that you can play all of your current Wii games on the system and use your Wii Fit or any other accessories you currently use with it.</p><p><strong>But Wii U\'s controller is not a standalone handheld console</strong></p><p>The controller needs to be tethered to the Wii U console to function - it isn\'t a PlayStation Vita competitor.</p><p><img alt=\"Wii u\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/E32011/Wii%20U%20-%202-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Wii U games will be plentiful</strong></p><p>\"Wii U was created so that the widest variety of games can be supported,\" says Nintendo. \"That means those aimed at experienced controllers that can use circle controllers using both their hands, plus those games that can be intuitively played without the need for any buttons.\"</p><p>Games design guru Shigeru Miyamoto says of Nintendo\'s new home console: \"More than anything I\'m really looking forward to new styles of play... There are so many we\'re just trying to decide where to begin.\"</p><p>Ninty announced new content based on its own franchises such as <em>Mario </em>(see below) and <em>Zelda</em>, but more interestingly, <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/nintendo-wii-u-hardcore-games-announced-963318\">says our own Adam Hartley</a>, \"is that EA, Ubisoft, Sega and lots of other third party games developers were showing off new adult-themed, hardcore games that they are making for Nintendo\'s Wii U.\"</p><p><img alt=\"Mario\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/E32011/2011_SW01_1_scrn01_E3-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Wii u\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/E32011/2011_SW01_2_scrn02_E3-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>\"Graphically, many of the games look on par with new AAA titles on PS3 or Xbox 360.</p><p>\"Hardcore favourites such as <em>Tekken, Assassin\'s Creed, Batman Arkham City</em> and <em>Ghost Recon Online</em> were also demonstrated.

And Wii sales finally show signs of decline, Nintendo needs a new console to maintain its momentum.</p><p>Our colleagues at T3.com have rounded up the latest rumours in the <a href=\"http://www.t3.com/feature/wii-2-rumours-specs-and-info-we-know-so-far\">Wii 2 video</a> below:</p><p> </p><p>          <!-- This script tag will cause the Brightcove Players defined above it to be created as soon as the line is read by the browser.

Game Informer started the rumour mill turning, citing the existence of an HD-ready Wii from mysterious \'multiple sources\'. French website 01net.com then <a href=\"http://www.01net.com/editorial/531660/project-cafe-la-wii-2-de-nintendo-aura-une-tablette-pour-manette/\">chipped in</a> with the Project Café codename and suggested core specs that could eclipse those of the Xbox 360 and PS3.</p><p><strong>Wii 2 specs could include a touchscreen display…</strong></p><p>The 01net.com website has form - it previously leaked the specs of Sony\'s NGP handheld before the official reveal. So it\'s tempting to believe that the Wii 2 could indeed be powered by a three-core IBM Power PC chip, feature an ATI R700 GPU for 1080p/3D visuals and use a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/wii-2-controller-to-have-6-2-inch-touchscreen--946158\">unique gamepad</a> with a 6.2-inch touchscreen, dual analogue sticks and a built-in camera.</p><p>This machine would also be backward-compatible with the current Wii and its motion-sensing peripherals, enabling it to go head-to-head with Kinect and PlayStation Move. </p><p>Such a specification would make the Wii 2 faster than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3. But you\'ll note that it\'s hardly cutting-edge tech we\'re talking about here. In contrast, the components are proven, reliable and reasonably cheap. If this is the specification Nintendo opts for, it won\'t take two years to turn a profit on each Wii 2 sold.</p><p>It seems the Wii U will <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/nintendo-wii-u-will-have-3d-support-976102\">have the ability</a> to support 3D games, but Nintendo won\'t be focusing on this feature when it is launched in 2012.</p><p>That\'s according to Satoru Iwata, the president of Nintendo – who was speaking to MercuryNews about its 3D capabilities.</p><p>\"If you are going to connect Wii U with a home TV capable of displaying 3D images, technologically, yes, it is going to be possible, but that\'s not the area we are focusing on,\" he explained.</p><p><strong>Goodbye Wii, hello \'Stream\'?</strong></p><p>There\'s a good chance that Nintendo\'s new console won\'t be called the Wii 2, Wii HD, Super Wii, \'Wii Wii\' or any other variation of Wii. <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/the-tech-behind-wii-2-latest-details-on-nintendo-stream-946271\">IGN has heard</a> the name \'Stream\', but it could be one of many names up for consideration. </p><p>Moving on from the Wii brand would make sense if Nintendo is building a powerful machine to win back hard-core Western gamers. Rather than recycle Wii Sports Resort and Just Dance in 1080p Full HD, Nintendo has its eye on greater 3rd-party software support. <a href=\"http://www.next-gen.biz/news/nintendo-confirms-wii-successor\">EDGE claims</a> that \"Ubisoft, Activision and Electronic Arts have had development units of the new hardware for months.\"</p><p>Of course, having AAA titles such as <em>Mortal Kombat</em> and <em>LA Noire</em> alongside a next-gen <em>Mario Kart</em> or <em>Zelda</em> on the Wii 2 isn\'t going to win Nintendo many converts. It will also need to revolutionise its online offering for the Wii 2 to be taken seriously as a credible gaming machine.</p><p><strong>Wii 2 release date</strong></p><p>With the Wii 2 set to be <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/consoles/nintendo-confirms-wii-successor-for-e3-947319\">revealed at this year\'s E3</a>, then it\'s possible that Nintendo could start rolling it out before Christmas. But given the complexity of a global console launch, early 2012 looks a more sensible bet. That would give Nintendo two years to rack up sales if Sony and Microsoft don\'t launch new consoles until 2014.</p><p>\"Nintendo is doing this one right,\" an anonymous source told Game Informer. \"[It\'s] not a gimmick like the Wii.\" The statement is a little harsh on the Wii, which opened up video gaming to a whole new demographic.

Nintendo hopes that the recent launch of a 3D remake of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time </em>and 3D versions of a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/nintendo-at-e3-top-five-moments-963606\" title=\"blocked::http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/nintendo-at-e3-top-five-moments-963606\">number of other hardcore favourites</a> such as <em>Mario</em>, <em>Kid Icarus </em>and <em>Starfox</em> slated for release later this year should help to drive sales of its new hardware.</p><p><img alt=\"3DS\" src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/TechRadar/Gadgets/Nintendo%203DS%20review/ONM66.feat_builtin.main_3ds-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>NINTENDO 3DS: </strong><em>What\'s coming next for handheld gaming?</em></p><p>\"While Nintendo\'s shown a huge ability to innovate and remove themselves from the traditional \"better hardware, better graphics\" race, the 3DS sales have so far been a disappointment,\" says Adam Taylor, in-house analyst at gaming agency <a href=\"http://www.adotomi.com/\" title=\"blocked::http://www.adotomi.com/\">Adotomi.com</a>, \"[it suggests] that people\'s imagination have not been captured by 3D technology as they were by motion control.</p><p>\"Sony, opting for stronger hardware and a bigger, better screen with the new PS Vita, likely read the market correctly (before 3DS sales made it clear) and made the surer bet in the short-to-medium term to forego 3D technology in order to deliver what handheld players are probably looking for: a better traditional handheld gaming experience. The superior OLED screen is probably the most obvious evidence of this choice.\"</p><p>Nintendo also recently revealed that forthcoming new Wii U console – slated for release later in 2012 – is also going to be <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/nintendo-wii-u-will-have-3d-support-976102\" title=\"blocked::http://www.techradar.com/news/gaming/nintendo-wii-u-will-have-3d-support-976102\">fully 3D capable</a>, although 3D content will not be the company\'s major focus around that console\'s launch. But it has led to speculation that there could well be some form of synchronisation of 3DS 3D gaming content and 3D gaming content on your TV via your Wii U console in the future.</p><p><strong>What about mobile?<br /></strong></p><p>Back to the present day, Nintendo is set to face some serious competition in the glasses-free 3D gaming stakes from mobile phone companies over the coming year, with the likes of HTC and LG already announcing their plans for 3D mobiles and accompanying partnerships with leading mobile games developers to create 3D titles for these latest smartphones.</p><p>LG is first off the starting blocks this month, having already announced a number of 3D mobile games from Gameloft for the new <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/lg-optimus-3d-930902/review?src=rss&amp;attr=all\" title=\"blocked::http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/lg-optimus-3d-930902/review?src=rss&amp;attr=all\">LG Optimus 3D</a> - with Dr. Jong-seok Park, President and CEO of LG Electronics Mobile, going as far as announcing that \"the era of dedicated handheld gaming platform is over.\" </p><p>LG later retracted that release and removed that part of the CEO\'s statement, although the intention of the company when it comes to 3D mobile gaming is clear.</p><p>\"Today\'s smartphones have the horsepower to compete with the best portable gaming devices and LG Optimus 3D is our proof,\" read the CEO\'s re-jigged statement. \"We think 3D is the natural next step in portable entertainment and LG is eager to throw its hat in the ring with the Optimus 3D and Gameloft\'s \'must-be-seen-to-be-believed\' titles.\"</p><p>Users can download 17 Gameloft S-3D games via the <em>3D Games</em> icon on the LG Optimus 3D, with a decent smattering of titles on offer at launch, including <em>Assassin\'s Creed: Altaïr\'s Chronicles</em>,<em> James Cameron\'s Avatar</em>,<em> Ultimate Spider Man: Total Mayhem</em>,<em> GT Racing: Motor Academy</em>,<em> Shrek Kart</em>,<em> Modern Combat 2: Black Pegasus</em>,<em> Real Football 2011</em>,<em> Star Battalion</em>,<em> N.O.V.A. 2 </em>and more.</p><p><img alt=\"HTC evo 3d\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/handhelds/images/handheld3d/The%20HTC%20Evo%203D%20-%20No%20parterships%20with%20games%20developers%20have%20so%20far%20been%20announced%20by%20HTC-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>3D MOBILE:</strong><em> No parterships with games developers have so far been announced by HTC for the Evo 3D<br /></em></p><p>\"Here at Gameloft we\'ve always had a philosophy of making games for the platforms people want to play them on,\" says Callum Rowley, Gameloft\'s UK PR manager. \"With the emergence of the Nintendo 3DS and now various smartphones with glasses-free 3D capabilities such as the LG Optimus 3D, we\'re seeing 3D as one of those platforms. </p><p>\"For now we\'re focused on bringing existing titles into the S-3D realm, but this doesn\'t mean we won\'t look at developing bespoke titles in the near future which take full advantage of the benefits S-3D brings to the enjoyment of games.</p><p>\"As long as phone manufacturers continue to bring innovative ideas, such as 3D, to their devices Gameloft will continue to develop tailored games to bring a truly entertaining experience to the end user.\"</p><p>So this first batch of stereoscopic 3D mobile gaming content from Gameloft is clearly an important toe-in-the-water for mobile games development, with many others in the mobile entertainment industry – the likes of Zynga, PopCap and EA Mobile – no doubt watching very closely, to ascertain the value of releasing 3D versions of their bigger mobile titles, or even developing brand new 3D IP purely for use on 3D-capable smartphones.</p><p><img alt=\"Avatar\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/handhelds/images/handheld3d/James%20Cameron%27s%20Avatar%20-%20another%203D%20title%20from%20Gameloft%20designed%20expressly%20for%20the%20LG%20Optimus%203D-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>AVATAR ON LG:</strong> <em>Avatar is one of several 3D partnerships that LG has formed to promote the Optimus 3D</em></p><p>One challenge to marketing 3D mobile gaming is the fact that you really do need to see and play it to understand how it works. And then decide whether or not you like it and want to shell out for it. </p><p>LG has recently employed London-based experiential marketing specialists <a href=\"http://www.hotcow.co.uk/\" title=\"blocked::http://www.hotcow.co.uk/\">HotCow</a> in an attempt to get Optimus 3D mobiles into the hands of gamers, \"because the thing that we have found, and all the research that we have done with this device, is that people don\'t actually believe it until they see it,\" says LG\'s UK PR manager Jerome Demare. </p><p><img alt=\"MArketing\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/handhelds/images/handheld3d/Marketing%203D%20is%20difficult%20-%20How%20to%20show%20off%20a%203D%20game%20on%20a%202D%20page%20%5Bquestionmark%5D-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>MARKETING CHALLENGE:</strong> <em>It\'s hard to market 3D games on 2D posters and other materials</em></p><p>While HTC has yet to announce any similar tie-ups with games developers, the company has recently announced news that it is to buy S3 Graphics, the US-based graphics-technology licensing company, for $300 million to boost its 3D graphics offerings in future. </p><p>This follows further recent acquisitions of London-based mobile-platform company Saffron Digital for $48.5 million (£30.2 million) and HTC also making a $40 million investment in cloud gaming company OnLive. With that latter announcement, following the release of the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/hands-on-htc-evo-3d-review-971603\" title=\"blocked::http://www.techradar.com/news/phone-and-communications/mobile-phones/hands-on-htc-evo-3d-review-971603\">HTC Evo 3D</a>, obviously raising the question: \"might we soon see 3D gaming content streamed directly to our mobile phones?\"</p><p><strong>3DS vs 3D tablets</strong></p><p>Still, despite these interesting first moves by the likes of Gameloft and LG, there are many in the 3D display industry that continue to cast aspersions on the long-term viability of 3D entertainment on mobile devices.</p><p>\"I think the simple reason is that 3D on a small screen is not very compelling,\" says Chris Chinnock, president of display industry analysts\' Insight Media. \"You have tight and narrow sweet spots and the depth volume is very small, so nothing has that much impact. This latter is a fundamental limitation of any handheld 3D display.\"</p><p>This is perhaps where 7-inch and 10-inch 3D tablet-style displays may start to win out over the Nintendo 3DS and smaller 3D smartphone screens in the future. Interestingly, established games developers who have traditionally focused on console and PC gaming are also branching out into the 3D mobile and tablet gaming arena, as Blitz Games\' CTO Andrew Oliver explains:</p><p>\"The potential for 3D on handheld devices is exciting. While the 3DS provides a great single-player no-glasses 3D experience, this would only be improved with a larger screen on a smart phone or tablet. </p><p>\"As well as the possibility for ultimately more advanced screen technology, these platforms also add the ability to view 3D movies and other content, either streamed or downloaded from a digital store, which will clearly be a big draw for a lot of consumers. As a lot of this content already exists I\'d be surprised if we don\'t see a device-and-business-model combination that will enable this for the mainstream before too long.\"</p><p>And there\'s the key. LG\'s team-up with Gameloft is a pointer towards what this type of \"device-and-business-model\" combination to deliver quality 3D content to your mobile might well look like in future. </p><p><strong>3D gaming baby steps</strong></p><p>The ability to shoot your own 3D video and photos, or view other rudimentary 3D content on YouTube, with phones such as the LG Optimus 3D, is really little more than an interesting gimmick for most users. </p><p>Yet when the market reaches that sweet-spot point where the average user is able to access quality AAA 3D games and movie content, easily and for a decent price, that is when 3D mobile games development will <em>really </em>start to take off. </p><p><img alt=\"Mario kart\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/gaming/handhelds/images/handheld3d/Mario%20Kart%203D%20-%20Nintendo%20is%20rolling%20out%203D%20versions%20of%20its%20classics%20this%20year-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>MARIO IN 3D:</strong><em> Nintendo is rolling out 3D versions of its classics this year </em></p><p>\"The introduction of 3D onto mobile devices brings the potential of enhanced level of richness to the multimedia experience,\" according to Stephen Yap, analyst and group director at TNS Technology, publishers of the annual <a href=\"http://discovermobilelife.com/\" title=\"blocked::http://discovermobilelife.com/\">Mobile Life</a> study.</p><p>\"The TNS Mobile Life study shows that gaming on mobile phones continues to increase - 55% of mobile phone owners in the UK are now playing games on their handsets. LG Optimus 3D and HTC EVO 3D are already at our door and operating on a common platform, presenting an opportunity for the increasingly talented developer community to break into 3D in a big way.</p><p>However, the analyst still thinks that \"the jury is still out on where exactly the sweet-spot for portable 3D gaming will reside… perhaps with the less-than-stellar take-up of 3DTV in mind, the gaming ecosystem is taking a cautious approach to the rollout of 3D gaming. </p><p>\"The lesson from 3DTV is that a \"build it and they will come\" approach may disappoint. Instead, with emerging technologies such as 3D and augmented reality the industry would be well served by first identifying consumer needs that the technology addresses, and marketing benefits, not technology itself.\"</p><p>Adotomi\'s Adam Taylor is adamant that 3D gaming has a healthy future, but is adamant that \"it lies on smartphones, not on dedicated gaming devices.\" </p><p>Taylor argues that Nintendo and Sony can mitigate this threat: \"Sony by delivering on a proper \"PlayStation phone\", and Nintendo either following a similar route and partnering with a handset maker, or – even better – publishing games for play across mobile phones, perhaps packaging its offer into some sort of \"Nintendo app\" in which its games could be purchased, played and stored, and through which the integrity of the Nintendo brand would be preserved.\" </p><p>---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

unfortunately, is not expanding enough,\" Iwata revealed.</p><p> \"And rather than pouring a lot of energy into that kind of area, with the Wii U we\'d like to focus more on each Wii U owner being

right place.</p><p>We\'ve got the ten best 3D TVs on the planet - both LCDs and plasma - and put them all in once place for your decision-making pleasure.</p><p>The jury\'s out on <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/hdtv/lcd-vs-plasma-which-is-the-best-for-3d-tv-715159\">which TV tech is best for 3D</a>, but we can already summarise the differences. </p><p>There\'s a feeling that for sheer 3D effects – especially in terms of depth and leap effects – the bright-and-breezy LCD sets from Samsung are the most effective. The downside is that LCD TVs do seem to be affected by \'crosstalk\' – when each eye sees part of the image intended only for the other eye.</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/hdtv/best-tv-2011-how-to-choose-the-best-tv-to-buy-709255\">Best TV 2011: All your buying questions answered</a></li></ul><p>Sony and LG\'s 3D TVs, meanwhile, are much cleaner, though not quite as impressive when it comes to the sheer impact of their 3D effects.</p><p>Plasma, meanwhile – only from Panasonic, so far – appears to be clean and free from crosstalk, but oh so dark. The glasses get rid of a huge amount of brightness to leave a rather dingy image, but arguably the most impressive and comfortable overall image.</p><p>Crosstalk remains a real and tiring barrier to enjoying 3D, especially over extended viewing periods. Plus, of course, its effect runs counter to the clarity of the HD Blu-ray images that \'alternate frame\' 3D was designed to keep – so choose carefully and try before you buy. </p><p>That\'s right, folks, you\'re being experimented on. That\'s for sure, and we expect the second generation of 3DTVs to be a good deal less \'crosstalky\'. </p><p>For now, here are the 12 best 3D TVs in order of price and awesomeness! </p><p><img alt=\"LG 42lw550t\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LW550T/LW550T%2045%20R_1-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>LG 42LW550T - £749</h4><p><strong>Seven pairs of 3D glasses star on this affordable slice of alternative 3D tech</strong></p><p>The 42-inch LG 42LW550T arrives with mixed expectations. It\'s the latest combatant in the increasingly rancorous scuffle between active shutter and FPR (Film Patterned Retarder) 3D technology, but – gaming aside (the screen does tend to lag) – fixes its reputation as one of the best examples of the latter.</p><p>The LG 42LW550T\'s picture quality with 3D is comfortable and engaging to watch. The fact that you get seven pairs of glasses bundled for free is brilliant, too, as is the fact that replacements cost barely a fiver.</p><p>While FPR TVs might not cut it with the picture-obsessed enthusiast market, they\'re a seriously persuasive proposition for the average family living room – and this one more than most.</p><p><strong>Read: </strong><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs/lg-42lw550t-954985/review\">LG 42LW550T review</a></p><p><img alt=\"rating\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Stars/TechRadar%20stars/TechRadar_4.5_stars-200-100.jpg\" width=\"200\" /></p><p><img alt=\"panasonic-tx-p42gt30\" src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Satellite/WST%20302/WST302.panansonic.panGT30B2_1-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Panasonic TX-P42GT30B - £855</h4><p><strong>Clean 3D and Viera Connect chum-up on this 42-inch plasma TV</strong></p><p>The GT30 range is Panasonic\'s secret weapon in its continuing war with 3D LED TV vendors, although – strictly speaking – this is merely a 3D-ready set. </p><p>We say that because no active shutter 3D glasses are bundled with this plasma, which is a strange decision since is handles the third dimension with aplomb.</p><p>Showing next to no double imaging, even on 3D Blu-rays with known problem sequences, the 3D crosstalk that was evident on last year\'s models has all but vanished from this season\'s screens. </p><p>Even on 2D it excels; black levels are profound and colour reproduction is bold yet believable. </p><p>Add some multimedia skills and the superb BBC iPlayer-endowed Viera Connect online hub and this is one plasma that edges perfection. </p><p><strong>Read: </strong><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs/panasonic-tx-p42gt30b-958956/review]\">Panasonic TX-P42GT30B review</a></p><p><img alt=\"rating\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Stars/TechRadar%20stars/TechRadar_4.5_stars-200-100.jpg\" width=\"200\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Panasonic tx-p42vt30b\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/Panasonic%20TX-P42VT30B/11577_TX-P42VT30B_2_1-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Panasonic TX-P42VT30B - £1,309</h4><p><strong>An imperious example of why plasma is a hugely potent TV tech for the 3D age</strong></p><p>The TX-P42VT30B is a TV made for AV enthusiasts.

And that\'s true of the biggest – and best – 3DTV so far, though the 65-inch TX-65VT20 (and its little sister, the 50-inch TX-P50VT20) isn\'t as glamorous as we\'d like in spite of its bronze finish. </p><p>The inclusion of two pairs of glasses is generous, though they\'re uncomfortable and let an annoying amount of light in. So it\'s lights-off time for 3D, not least because the only plasma 3D Series of TVs so far lose considerable brightness in 3D mode when compared to its LCD rivals.</p><p>Just as well, then, that the TX-P65VT20 has as immense black level response and far less obvious crosstalk issues than you\'ll find on any active LCD 3D TV. It\'s not immune to the tell-tale double ghosting of objects in the mid-to-far distance, but the overall image is crisp and convincing.</p><p>There may be no 2D-to-3D conversion circuitry and there is room for improvement, but this enormous Panasonic plasma arguably serves up the best 3D TV pictures currently available. </p><p><strong>Read:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs/panasonic-tx-p50vt20b-688360/review\">Panasonic TX-P65VT20B review</a></p><p><img alt=\"rating\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Stars/TechRadar%20stars/TechRadar_5_stars-200-100.jpg\" width=\"200\" /></p><p><img alt=\"panasonic-th-85vx200b\" src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/Panasonic%20TH-85VX200B/TH-85VX200slant_h_A-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Panasonic TH-85VX200 - £42,000</h4><p><strong>The ultimate 3D display is as expensive as it is vast</strong></p><p>At around £42,000 this is a screen for super-wealthy only, though in this \'best 3DTV\' contest it would be churlish to deny this 85-inch its moment of glory. It also offers a tempting glance of the direction in which we expect all 3DTVs to be heading thanks to the trickle-down technology trend.</p><p>Arguably you could get a cheaper projector to deliver even bugger sized pictures, but then you\'d need a blackout; no need here as this plasma – complete with custom-built hydraulic floor mounts and cooling fans – produces pin-sharp 2D and 3D pictures thanks to tech like Motion Vector Prediction circuitry, 30-bit colour processing and an ultra-high speed drive system.

the most convincing 3D pictures we\'ve seen.</p><p>Contrast, colour and sheer detail are the picture highlights, but this TV goes way beyond its great 3D and 2D work; a robotic camera, home automation options and speaker opportunities are excellent – if incredibly expensive – as is the touchscreen remote and iPhone app. </p><p>But it\'s that choice of plasma that\'s pivotal to this screens success.

You bet! Read on to learn why IFA 2011 could be the most significant in years.</p><p><strong>IFA firsts</strong></p><p>IFA is not just another gadget show. It\'s a technology event on an enormous scale. Last year, the Internationale Funkausstellung Berlin attracted over 230,000 visitors. And yes, it is open to the public.</p><p>Indeed, the IFA site is so huge it has its own transport system to help get folks around. With more attendees and exhibition space than CES, it can legitimately claim to be the world\'s biggest tech expo.</p><p>Amazingly, the show first opened its doors way back in 1924. Since then it\'s seen numerous tech milestones.</p><p>In 1930 Albert Einstein gave a keynote speech about the future of radio; five years later the event introduced the first magnetic recording tape. In 1967 PAL colour televisions made their debut, and then in 1981 CD players were unveiled before a curious public. It was at IFA, in 1995, that European broadcasters began to demonstrate digital TV for the first time. </p><p>So what will IFA 2011 will be remembered for?</p><p><strong>Big buzzwords</strong></p><p>Naturally, the big brands are keeping product announcements and developments close to their chests, as they prepare for the big IFA reveal on 1 September. Until then rumour and speculation is the name of the game. That said, it\'s not too difficult to predict the direction that tech winds will be blowing.</p><p>The big buzzwords bouncing around the halls of IFA 2011 will be (in no particular order) 4K2K, Smart TV, autostereocopic 3D and tablets. Feel free to combine any and all of these to produce your imaginary device of choice.</p><p>Those who have been hoping that the 3D bandwagon would at least develop a slow puncture (yes, amazingly there are a few naysayers still out there) are likely to be disappointed. The big 3D TV makers will all be hawking better-than-ever third generation displays.</p><p>One highlight you can expect to see in the Panasonic hall is the brand\'s astonishing new 152inch 3D plasma. We\'ve already had a preview of this monster and can confirm it is quite simply the most jaw-dropping flat-panel on the planet. </p><p>Panasonic has long enjoyed producing impractically large plasmas (just because it can), and this is its most ambitious screen yet. The 4K Active Shutter panel has a resolution of 8 million pixels; at a recent demo we watched in slack-jawed amazement as it upscaled <em>Avatar</em> from a standard Panasonic 3D Blu-ray player. </p><p>2011 has already been deemed the year of the smart TV by the likes of Samsung and LG, and this message is only likely to be reinforced at IFA 2011. While Ethernet is now de rigueur on all types of CE gear, Wi-Fi has been an awkward add-on. However, come IFA, the dongle will go the way of the Dodo, as building-in becomes the new going out.</p><p><strong>Back to the future</strong></p><p>IFA has a habit of repeating itself. So expect those uber-cool products unveiled at IFA 2010, but still conspicuous by their absence in the real world, to return refreshed. We\'ll bet dollars to doughnuts that you\'ll witness the second coming of LG\'s fabled Nano-LED TVs, only this time with Cinema 3D passive tech replacing the Active Shutter 3D system they were originally shown with.</p><p><img alt=\"LG nano\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/events/IFA_2011/LG%20NAno%20LED-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>BACK AGAIN:</strong> <em>First shown last year, but still not on sale, LG\'s Nano LED screens will get a Passive 3D makeover at IFA</em></p><p>Of course, LG will still be shilling gear unlikely to ship anytime soon. We predict the highlight of the LG hall will be its first large screen 4K2K 3D display. This will use the brand\'s proprietary FPR (Film Pattern Retarder) filter and, thanks to the higher resolution of the 4K panel, will be able to produce the first ever Full HD resolution (1920 x 1080) Passive 3D picture. </p><p>LG\'s rival Samsung does not traditionally use IFA to launch swathes of new kit, reserving that privilege for January\'s CES event. However, the company does like to steal a headline or two. One way it could do this is by taking the wraps off its own radical new 3D TV technology. </p><p>The brand is known to have done a deal with 3D pioneer Real D to create a new generation of displays which deliver Full HD 3D using passive polarising glasses. No specifics have been announced, but by shifting shuttering LCD tech to the panel and away from high-tech eyeware, the brand will free itself from the expensive handcuffs that are Active Shutter spectacles.</p><p>Over in Toshiba\'s hall, there\'s certain to be a massive push on autostereoscopic (no glasses needed) 3D. We predict Toshiba will show a groundbreaking 55inch Auto-3D screen. The company has already touted prototypes and seems firmly committed to making autostereocopic TV happen. Of course, you won\'t be able to buy one until at least 2012. </p><p><strong>The evolution of the tablet</strong></p><p>Naturally, tablets will be everywhere at IFA 2011, with dozens of cookie-cutter slates on hand. What will be new, however, is how they\'ll be positioned. Many of these handhelds will be promoted as your next second TV screen. </p><p>Samsung used IFA 2010 to launch its original Samsung Galaxy Tab and it looks like the company will be using this year\'s show to launch a follow-up device - the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/samsung-galaxy-q-what-you-need-to-know-981656\">Samsung Galaxy Q</a>. The rumour is that it\'s a \"tabphone\" that\'s half tablet, half phone. Read more about the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/mobile-computing/tablets/samsung-galaxy-q-what-you-need-to-know-981656\">Samsung Galaxy Q here</a>. </p><p>We know that Panasonic\'s first tablets will allow you to access its Viera Connect IPTV and apps store directly, as well as act as a turbo-charged remote control for a tethered screen. </p><p><img alt=\"Viera tablet\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/events/IFA_2011/VIERA%20tablet-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>TABLET FRENZY:</strong> <em>A new wave of tablet devices will launch, aimed at enhancing the TV viewing experience</em></p><p>IFA 2011 won\'t just be about hardware, though. Reflecting the rise of Smart devices, there will be a new emphasis on apps and content. </p><p>Samsung UK\'s AV marketing chief Russell Owens says that IFA 2011 will be about more than just kit. \"You can be certain apps and services will be a big story at this year\'s event,\" he told us. </p><p>Sony spokesperson Lucie Speciale agrees, saying that for Sony IFA 2011 will be about \"discovering new services and most importantly experiencing digital content in ways that haven\'t been seen before.\" She adds \"key themes will be connectivity, mobility, entertainment and the next stages of 3D.\" </p><p>We can\'t wait. </p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/165662fb/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/1698de15/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cmore0Ethan0E10A0Eof0Enew0Etv0Es0E3d0Eenabled0Eby0Eend0Eof0E20A110E9780A710Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">More than 10% of new TV\'s 3D-enabled by end of 2011</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/169f30e9/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Csony0E3d0Eexperience0Elaunches0Efor0Ebravia0Esmart0Etvs0E9785450Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Sony 3D Experience launches for Bravia smart TVs</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16aeab46/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0C3d0Etv0Eprices0Eon0Ethe0Erise0E9793310Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">3D TV prices on the rise</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16d8900a/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Clg0Eto0Elaunch0Ea0E55in0Eoled0Etv0Ein0E20A120E9818750Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">LG to launch a 55in OLED TV in 2012</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16ef8a2b/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cfreesat0Ebegins0Eitv0Eplayer0Eroll0Eout0E9837390Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Freesat begins ITV Player roll out</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Updated%3A+IFA+2011%3A+what+to+expect+from+this+year%27s+show&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Ftelevision%2Fifa-2011-what-to-expect-from-this-year-s-show-973524%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Updated%3A+IFA+2011%3A+what+to+expect+from+this+year%27s+show&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Ftelevision%2Fifa-2011-what-to-expect-from-this-year-s-show-973524%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106216198582/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/165662fb/kg/216-221-259/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106216198582/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/165662fb/kg/216-221-259/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~4/mIZQPcr9i8A\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~3/mIZQPcr9i8A/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/television\n',9970,NULL,'2011-07-26 16:13:00'),(150,'Buying Guide: 10 best 42-inch HD TVs in the world today','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20359/WHV359.phil42.main-200-200.jpg\" /><p><em>Our constantly updated list of the top 10 best 40-inch, 42 and 46-inch plasma and LCD TVs in the world today.<br /></em></p><p>Once known simply as \'plasma screens\' in the collective consciousness, the 42-inch size is where the flatscreen dream started in the late 1990s – and where it\'s still at its most innovative and best.</p><p>Now a lot more varied, with plasmas rubbing shoulders with (and quickly being outnumbered by) LCD TVs and their ultra-modern LED TV makeover, 40-46 inches is still the sweetspot for anyone not overly concerned with ruining the interior design of their living room.</p><p>As well as being the fastest growing sector of the TV market, this size is also great value.

Check all our reviews out below. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/hp-veer-933871/review\">HP Veer review</a></p><p>In the beginning, there was Palm. The company created the handheld/smartphone category with the original personal digital assistants in 1996. Now, following an HP acquisition about a year ago, it\'s emerged with a new super-tiny model, the HP Veer.</p><p>The smartphone is priced at $99 with a two-year contract in the US, with costs yet to be announced in the UK. It\'s so light, at 103g, and small, at 84x54x15.1mm, that it almost seems like a toy phone – something you would pass on to little Johnny Radar Jr in the back seat to keep him silent. The Veer is generally well-packaged, but unless it comes with a fantastic price point when it lands on UK shores, it\'s not going to be a winner for HP.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-apple-macbook-air-2011-review-981684\">New MacBook Air review</a></p><p>The MacBook Air that debuted last October was a mighty fine-looking piece of hardware - a newly designed unibody shell, 0.3cm at its thinnest. Trouble is, the meat inside didn\'t quite match up with the supreme exterior – Apple had been forced to stick with the ageing Intel Core 2 Duo processor. </p><p>The great news is that the new models don\'t lack for performance. Even the base models are stacked. The off-the-shelf models come with the blistering Core i5 1.6 (11-inch, £849/£999 depending on memory and SSD) or 1.7GHz (13-inch, £1,099/£1,349 depending on memory and SSD) variants. Even better is that, for an extra £100, you can upgrade to a 1.8GHz Core i7.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/nokia-x7-943467/review\">Nokia X7 review</a></p><p>The Nokia X7 ought to be a flagship smartphone – it has a vast screen, it runs a revamped touchscreen OS and it looks rather nice too. It has an 8MP camera, super video playback and, at first glance, plenty of storage capacity. But we just aren\'t sure where Symbian Anna is headed in the long term, and that alone could make the Nokia X7 a blind alley. </p><p>And it doesn\'t do anything supremely well. If you are a Nokia fan and want a top quality camera you should be looking at the Nokia N8. If you want a superb physical keyboard, then the Nokia E7 is worth your attention. Great social networking integration? Go Android instead, with something such as the HTC Sensation. With those bases covered, it\'s tricky to see precisely where the Nokia X7 fits in.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/phones/mobile-phones/samsung-galaxy-s-689293/review\">Samsung Galaxy S</a></p><p>One of the jewels in the previous-generation Android crown, the Samsung Galaxy S has recently been updated to Android 2.3.3, giving it Gingerbread features as well as improved performance and better battery life.

37-inch TVs in the world<br /></em></p><h4>Which is the best 37-inch TV?</h4><p>Making the decision to upgrade from a bulky old 28-inch CRT TV is almost too easy, but heading straight for a 42-inch plasma can seem a little daunting.</p><p>And thus the 37\" size has become one of the UK\'s most popular shapes; a lot more impressive than a 32-incher, yet not big enough to entirely dominate a living room. It\'s also often the maximum size for those of us who are forced, simply by the shape of our living room, to shove a TV in the corner.</p><p>It\'s a size division that\'s as competitive as any, with the big brands weighing in with both LCD and plasma TV models. Despite its direct forerunners being some of the best-reviewed (and best-selling) TVs around, Panasonic\'s TX-P37X20 is the only plasma left in this category.</p><ul><li><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/home-cinema/home-theatre-audio/11-best-sound-bar-speakers-for-your-hdtv-913392\">10 best sound bar systems for your HDTV</a></li></ul><p>Surrounded by LCD TVs not just from Panasonic, but from other huge brands like Sony, LG and Toshiba, the 37-inch size has become a battleground dominated by aggressively low pricing.</p><p>A buyer\'s market, the 37\" size is also home to some wonderful innovations. Here you\'ll find some sets properly exploiting a Full HD resolution, and TVs with built-in Freesat tuners, others with online dimensions, 100Hz scanning and even - in the case of Loewe\'s Connect - a luxury wireless TV that can stream music and video from a PC or Mac, before pumping out incredible sound.</p><p>Loewe is hardly typical of this cut-price - and sparsely populated - genre, but it shows just what can be done at this modest measurement.</p><p><img alt=\"panasonic-tx-p37x10\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20346/WHV346.pan37x10.1-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /> <img alt=\"sony-kdl-37s5500\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20348/WHV348.gtindepth.sony-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /> <img alt=\"toshiba-37rv555db\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20345/WHV345.tos&lt;strong&gt;7.toshiba1-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /> <img alt=\"lg-37lh7000\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20348/WHV348.gtindepth.lg_tv-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /> <img alt=\"lg-37lg7000\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20345/WHV345.lg37.front-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /></p><p><img alt=\"panasonic-tx-l37g10\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Plasma/WHP%2070/WHP70.37ingt.pan37-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /> <img alt=\"sony-kdl-37w5500\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20354/WHV354.gtindepth.sony_w-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /> <img alt=\"panasonic-tx-l37v10b\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20348/WHV348.pan37.7-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /> <img alt=\"sony-bravia-kdl-40z5800\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20354/WHV354.sony40.1-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /> <img alt=\"loewe-connect-media-32\" src=\"http://mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/What%20Video/WHV%20338/WHV338.loewe32.2-80-100.jpg\" width=\"80\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Panasonic tx-p37x20\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/Panasonic%20TX-P37X20/TX-P37X20-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Panasonic TX-P37X20B</h4><p><strong>Affordable HD ready plasma with excellent all-round performance</strong></p><p>Plasmas are exceedingly rare at this size, but previous generations of this particular model have routinely been honoured – and this version is no different. It lacks much of the more advanced functions seen further up Panasonic\'s range, but for frugal buyers who don\'t want to pay for extra bells and whistles, it delivers big performance bangs for a modest buck. It\'s merely HD Ready – not Full HD – but with a super-clean performance from its built-in Freeview tuner it makes the perfect all-rounder for living rooms.</p><p><strong>Read: </strong><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs/panasonic-tx-p37x20-683931/review\">Panasonic TX-P37X20B review</a></p><p><img alt=\"4stars\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Stars/TechRadar4stars-200-100.jpg\" width=\"200\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Panasonic tx-l37dt30b\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/Panasonic%20TX-L37DT30B/11654_TX-L37DT30B_2_1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Panasonic TX-L37DT30B</h4><p><strong>BBC iPlayer plus built-in Freeview/Freesat HD tuners on this 3D Edge LED TV</strong></p><p>Panasonic\'s first effort at an Edge LED TV is also 3D-ready, although it\'s sized to steer clear of competing with the brand\'s barnstorming 3D plasmas – and the TX-L37DT30B comes a clear second place, judged purely on 3D images. </p><p>Still, compared to other 3D LCD TVs, this DT30 Series set is a competitive performer that pairs 3D with quite wonderful 2D, and even Freeview HD and Freesat HD tuners. Yes – both!</p><p>The appearance of BBC iPlayer – at last – on Panasonic\'s Viera Connect platform is welcome, as are deep blacks, an effective anti-blur system, HD detail and some striking colours. </p><p>Panasonic\'s first 3D LCD TV is a huge success. So huge, in fact, that we have little issue with declaring this one of the finest 37-inchers in the business. </p><p><strong>Read: </strong><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs/panasonic-tx-l37dt30b-958929/review\">Panasonic TX-L37DT30B review</a></p><p><img alt=\"4.5 stars\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Stars/TechRadar%20stars/TechRadar_4.5_stars-200-100.jpg\" width=\"200\" /></p><p><img alt=\"Sharp lc-37le320\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/Sharp%20LC-37LE320/LC-37LE320E%20product-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Sharp LC-37LE320</h4><p><strong>Sharp puts on the style with this natty LED Freeview screen</strong></p><p>Affordable and contemporary, but not loaded with the latest tech, Sharp\'s 37-incher offers LED backlighting and a mere 45mm depth.

people in the UK. </p><p>But within this size division, there\'s plenty of choice. A basic HD-ready set can be found for less than £300 is you search hard, though it\'s just as easy to spend over £2k. </p><p>There\'s only one certainty at this size - your new TV will be a LCD TV. If you\'re lucky it could have LED backlighting, but it won\'t be a plasma; LG used to make plasmas at this size, but there\'s not one on sale currently. </p><p>A typical circa £500 purchase will sport a Full HD screen, have at least three HDMI inputs, and some kind of 100Hz scanning, though the latter feature varies so much in effectiveness that you\'ve simply got to see it in action in the shop before you shell out any extra cash.</p><ul><li><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/home-cinema/home-theatre-audio/11-best-sound-bar-speakers-for-your-hdtv-913392\">10 best sound bar systems for your HDTV</a></li></ul><p>Full HD, media streaming and even built-in Freesat HD or Freeview HD - it\'s all possible on these small TVs.</p><p>Freeview HD is on some of these TVs, but not all.

But it is the disc that is essential to the quality of the product.</p><p><strong>Future proofing</strong></p><p>\"Blu-ray at the moment is the best way for consumers to directly own content because they get the best quality and it\'s future-proofing at the same time,\" explained Marcais.</p><p>\"We are looking at all different types of things: electronic, digital and physical stuff. But our focus at the moment is really Blu-ray.\"</p><p>Blu-ray sales are up year on year and with Blu-ray player prices dropping way below the £100 mark, it is a format that\'s becoming part of the mainstay. </p><p>However, the proliferation of digital downloads will eventually mean that Blu-ray\'s market share will shrink. </p><p>As Danny Kaye explained to TechRadar, though, Fox is hoping that the eco-system it is helping create with the digital locker service <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/video/blu-ray/blu-ray-celebrates-its-fifth-birthday-968433\">UltraViolet</a> will enrich Blu-ray buying and not hinder it.</p><p><strong>\"</strong>The concept of UltraViolet is giving something extra,\" explained Kaye. </p><p>\"If I want to watch it on a large screen TV in the best quality, I get a Blu-Ray disc. But if I also get a DVD then I can move that around the players that I might have in other places including a car or my computer.</p><p>\"And then with UltraViolet, I will be able to download a stream to any number of portable devices, then that\'s a lot of flexibility. </p><p>\"So I buy one title and I can do any number of things with it. That should shift from a \'rental-streaming\' model, to a \'purchase-own\' store.\"</p><p><strong>UltraViolet - ultra backing</strong></p><p>UltraViolet is being backed by some 70 companies and it acts as a digital locker for your content. While the idea is sound, the concept at the moment does mean that titles you have bought before the UltraViolet launch will not be part of this locker.</p><p>Kaye, however, did hint to us that Fox was looking at ways to get previously bought content on to the service.</p><p>\"We\'re talking about all of these kinds of things and sure it\'s going to happen… there may be easier ways to do it than in the past where you could end up digitising each part of your library.\"</p><p>Marcais agreed with this, and explained to TechRadar: \"Finding the good solutions for people to digitise their existing library will prepare them to be more willing to buy them in the new environment.\"</p><p>UltraViolet is set for a UK launch sometime later in the year. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16d1d682/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/161d64d7/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cvideo0Cblu0Eray0Cfox0Edigital0Ecopies0Ewith0Eblu0Eray0Eare0Ethe0Eperfect0Ecombination0E9698230Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Exclusive: Fox: Digital copies with Blu-ray are the perfect combination</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Exclusive%3A+Twentieth+Century+Fox%3A+Blu-ray+is+our+main+focus&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fvideo%2Fblu-ray%2Ftwentieth-century-fox-blu-ray-is-our-main-focus-981560%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Exclusive%3A+Twentieth+Century+Fox%3A+Blu-ray+is+our+main+focus&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fvideo%2Fblu-ray%2Ftwentieth-century-fox-blu-ray-is-our-main-focus-981560%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108467341288/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/16d1d682/kg/221-253-259-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108467341288/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/16d1d682/kg/221-253-259-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~4/lQNBF657A1c\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~3/lQNBF657A1c/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/television\n',5549,NULL,'2011-07-21 11:17:00'),(158,'In Depth: The future of 3D TV content','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/home-entertainment/high-definition/images/3dtv-content/3D%20concert%20footage-200-200.jpg\" /><p>If you have recently treated yourself or the family to a new 3D TV, or are considering making an investment in 3D for the home soon, then you will no doubt want to know what\'s in store for the future of decent quality 3D content.</p><p>Hollywood has come under flack of late, with a rep from <a href=\"http://www.in.com/news/science-technology/fullstory-panasonic-hollywood-damaged-3d-19646524-in-1.html\">3D TV manufacturer Panasonic</a> claiming that Tinseltown\'s rush to produce \"badly converted\" 3D movies in the wake of the success of James Cameron\'s <em>Avatar </em>has \"damaged 3D\".</p><p><p>It\'s certainly true that even the most impressive camera and projection technology cannot improve a bad script or a poorly-directed movie. But where does this current feeling of unease about 3D leave 3D TV viewers? Where do producers and directors hope to see commercial 3D TV programming from the likes of of Sky and Virgin Media going in 2012 and beyond? </p><p>While mainstream 3D TV coverage is likely to continue to be dominated by major sporting events such as the forthcoming London 2012 Olympics and other types of \"event TV\" – is there also a chance that we might soon start to see more investment from broadcasters in decent new 3D drama and documentary content?</p><p>Plus, it\'s not only broadcasters who are shaping the future of 3D TV content creation and delivery, with manufacturers such as Samsung and Sony recently launching their own 3D TV-on-demand services, to boost early adopter sales of their latest 3D television sets.</p><p><strong>TV manufacturers and BBC offer 3D VOD</strong></p><p>Sony, for example, recently announced its <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/sony-3d-experience-launches-for-bravia-smart-tvs-978545\">new 3D Experience video on demand streaming service</a> for its line of Bravia LCD smart TVs, delivering 3D highlights of the latest movies, sports and teasers of 3D PS3 games via the Bravia Internet Video service.</p><p>The service will soon be extended to Sony\'s 3D-capable Blu-ray players, and, even though it is little more than a glorified advertising service for Sony movies and games right now, it is hoped that the 3D VOD offering will be improved over time, with Sony delivering on the somewhat vague promises to \"further expand the content line-up and promote 3D Experience among content holders as a forum through which to showcase their 3D offerings.\"</p><p>For its part, Samsung has been quickest off the starting blocks in the emergent 3D TV market, already having captured over 50 per cent of market share in North America and Europe, according to German market researchers GfK. Samsung sold 50.5 percent of 3D TVs in Europe in May 2011, followed by Sony with a 21.8 percent market share, and LG Electronics and Panasonic with 9.3 and 9.2 per cent, respectively.</p><p>Samsung\'s latest move is to offer its ownfree 3D video-on-demand service offering free movies, music videos and nature documentaries, delivered via the \"Explore 3D\" App on Samsung Smart TVs. </p><p><img alt=\"Samsung explore\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/high-definition/images/3dtv-content/Samsung%27s%20Explore%203D-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>EXPLORE 3D:</strong> <em>TV manufacturers are now starting to offer their own exclusive 3D VOD services</em></p><p>And, not to be outdone by the early moves of Sky and Virgin Media into the 3D TV broadcast arena, the BBC is currently <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/bbc-looking-at-vod-for-3d-content-957109\">looking at VOD for 3D content</a>, with Danielle Nagler, head of HD and 3D at the BBC, revealing at the recent <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/sky-we-can-do-for-3d-what-we-did-for-hd-956687\">3DTV World Forum</a> that \"3D feels more instinctively like a VOD proposition in the long-term, rather than a channel proposition for the BBC.\"</p><p>The BBC is already filming some of its flagship entertainment properties, such as<em>Strictly Come Dancing</em> (\"one of the most polished 3D shoots ever done in a studio\")and has the 3D TV rights to major sporting events such as Wimbledon, which clearly shows that aunty is looking at 3D as a seriously important, long-term commercial proposition.</p><p>However, while the BBC\'s 3D baby steps andthe various promotional gimmicks from TV manufacturers are welcome amongst new or soon-to-be 3D TV buyers, the bottom line (for the most discerning viewers, at least) is knowing how and where proper, good quality 3D content is going to be produced and broadcast in the future. </p><p><strong>The future of 3D event TV</strong></p><p>Sky 3D has been instrumental in paving the way for mass market acceptance of the latest TV tech, with Sky\'s execs claiming that it hopes to do for 3D programming what it has already succeeded in doing for HD </p><p>John Cassy, director of <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/sky-3d-912655/review\">Sky 3D</a>, explained to delegates at the recent 3DTV World Forum that Sky now has\"over 3.5 million homes, paying us an extra £10 a month\" with over 50 channels now in HD.\"I can\'t see why we can\'t build the take up of 3D in this country, with a similar model.\"</p><p>Following that event, and speaking exclusively to TechRadar, Cassy also revealed that, even though Sky 3D has already been on air since October 2010, \"it\'s fair to say that we are still fairly close to the start of our journey of 3D, but if you look at what we\'ve achieved in this time, I think it has been a very strong start. </p><p>\"We\'ve delivered more than 120 live 3D sports events – more than any other broadcaster in the world – including some really major world events such as the Champions League Final, the Ryder Cup, the US Masters, the FA Cup final and more, across a broad number of sports. </p><p>\"We also have deals in place with all the major Hollywood studios, and we are showing 3D films in regular slots every Friday and Sunday – and we expect that to increase in the coming year.Plus, we\'ve also gone into new areas, including winning the first ever BAFTA for a 3D documentary with David Attenborough\'s <em>Flying Monsters.</em>\"</p><p>It\'s clearly been a busy ten months for Cassy and his team at Sky 3D, but he is in no way shy of admitting that they \"still know that we\'ve got a lot to do, because it is an early-stage technology and we are learning about it all of the time.\"</p><p>While they haven\'t released official viewing figures for some time, Sky\'s subscription numbers for Sky 3D are already into the (low) six figures, so what are the plans to expand and improve the 3D offering in the future?</p><p><strong>3D London Olympics and Rugby World Cup</strong></p><p>Cassy is bullish about his belief that Sky 3D is \"is about providing the best of TV entertainment, but in a way that you have never seen it before - the biggest Premier League games, the biggest golfing events, the biggest movies, through to the best ballets or the most amazing exclusive factual shows. We are looking to try to drive \"event television\" – those things that are real treats for customers.\"</p><p>Researchers at GfK predict that around 1.5 million 3D-ready TV sets will have been sold in the UK by the time of the 2012 Olympics, also claiming that the initial take-up of 3D TV has been quicker than HD TVs and flat-screens. </p><p>\"It\'s going to be a significant marketplace,\"adds Cassy, warming to his theme, \"and Sky is optimistic about what other people are and will be doing. It\'s great to see the BBC experimenting around the Wimbledon final coverage and doing a very good job. </p><p>\"There are a couple of other big events coming up later this year, such as the Rugby World Cup finals. And there is already a big debate around whether the London Olympics will be in 3D. And Sky would of course love to see the relevant rights holders broadcast both of those events in 3D.\"</p><p><strong>Where now for 3D drama?</strong></p><p>Chasing the exclusive rights to ever-better quality 3D coverage of the world\'s biggest sports \"event TV\" is clearly a fairly obvious strategy for any broadcaster with a premium 3D offering, but what of 3D drama and documentary programming?</p><p>Sky has already made something of a splash in promoting cutting-edge arts and documentary 3D production, with <em>Matthew Bourne\'s Swan Lake</em> ballet, the aforementioned David Attenborough dinosaur documentary and the recent Kylie concert all being shot in 3D.</p><p><img alt=\"Swan lake\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/high-definition/images/3dtv-content/3D%20Swan%20Lake-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>SWAN LAKE:</strong><em>Cutting-edge 3D arts programming from Sky</em></p><p>\"We\'ve also done lots more, such as a documentary with Brian May telling the story of 3D and music-based programmes with Sky Arts in their Songbooks\' series,\" Cassy reminds TechRadar.\"So we are trying to broaden out the range of the kind of programming that we are providing, but inevitably sports and movies will always register pretty highly on our lists of things to get to viewers.</p><p>\"In terms of new 3D drama, it is certainly something that we are looking at, but I don\'t think it is necessarily anything we are going to hurry into. The lead times, the logistics and the costs of drama – in 2D, let alone in 3D – are very significant. So we are treading carefully there. But I would hope that, before very long, you will see Sky do dramas in 3D.</p><p>\"And then, on the documentary side, we\'ve already worked with people like The History Channel and National Geographic. So we will continue to do our own 3D documentary making and we will start to partner more with these types of big specialist brands, who have real heritage in this area of programme-making.\" </p><p><strong>Virgin plumps for 3D on-demand</strong></p><p>Virgin Media also offers its customers 3D content via movies-on-demand, free tasters and trailers as well as 3D content exclusive to its XL package customers, having signed deals with Paramount, Disney and Warner Bros to broadcast the latest 3D movies soon after they are released. </p><p>Virgin has also offered sports fans live 3D sporting content from prestigious European sporting events, including the Roland Garros French Open. So what are the company\'s latest 3D plans to boost its competitive advantage over Sky, the BBC and other broadcasters?</p><p>\"As the first company to commercially launch a 3D TV offering, Virgin Mediacontinues to offer families the most up-to-date 3D content available on the market,\" argues Virgin Media\'s head of On Demand development,Kevin O\'Neil. \"We think that our On Demand service offers the best range of 3D content and a great way for families to get their 3D fix, allowing them to pick and choose what they want to watch, when they want to watch it.\"</p><p>It\'s a solid marketing pitch, yet backed up by a decent range of 3D content on offer for all ages, with watch-when-you-like 3D blockbusters such as <em>Disney\'s: TRON Legacy</em>, <em>Gulliver\'s Travels</em> and <em>Drive Angry</em>and plenty of quality wildlife and sci-fi documentaries already on offer.</p><p>\"We\'ll continue to work with 3D content providers such as Eurosport to bring our customers live sporting action in 3D,\" adds O\'Neil. \"Over the last few months, Virgin Media\'s 3D sports event coverage has gone from strength to strength, offering live 3D content from some of the most prestigious sporting events in Europe. </p><p>\"The increase in 3D coverage of major sporting events demonstrates the progress which is being made in sports broadcasting. It also highlights the commitment to innovation and development of this new technology as Eurosport and ESPN have recently demonstrated. </p><p><img alt=\"Concert kylie\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/high-definition/images/3dtv-content/3D%20concert%20footage-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>3D CONCERTS:</strong> <em>Sky is proud of its latest Kylie film</em></p><p>\"The main challenge for the future is for content providers to consistently deliver the best 3D viewing experience whether through live transmission or on demand, and also to create cost-effective combined 2D/3D events taking advantage of the technology. Virgin Media is keen to help the 3D industry grow. There is enormous potential for development in terms of the types of shows and events which can be offered and we will continue to work closely with content providers in continuing to provide the best and most up-to-date programming available on the market. </p><p>\"With the increasing numbers of Pay TV operators worldwide offering 3D linear or On Demand platforms, the demand for high quality 3D programming is increasing and content creators have an expanding market to provide content to. The Holy Grail for mass market take-up and acceptance isglassless 3D TVs, although some manufacturers are indicating that this may be five or more years away.\"</p><p>The Virgin Media exec is still cautious when it comes to committing to any specific promises for the future of 3D programming, beyond noting howhe expects to see an increasing number of 3D documentaries, dramas, music and arts programming, adding the caveat that,\"programming standards must be maintained with a good rule of thumb being that if doesn\'t make good 2D viewing then 3D is unlikely to help – you need a strong format and a genuine narrative coupled with high production values and quality talent.\"</p><p>\"It will take a bold filmmaker to produce a new drama or documentary in 3D beyond someone like Anthony Geffen of Atlantic Productions - who won a BAFTA 2011 for his film, <em>Flying Monsters 3D</em> - till the audience has reached a critical mass,\" argues Matthew Young, director of <a href=\"http://www.ipont3d.com/\">iPONT UK</a> an innovator and technology partner to the likes of Sky and the BBC in the glasses-free (auto-stereoscopic) 3D market. </p><p><img alt=\"3D tv content\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/home-entertainment/high-definition/images/3dtv-content/Auto-stereoscopic%203D-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>AUTO-STEREOSCOPIC: </strong><em>Although most in the TV industry think this is at least five years away for the home market</em></p><p>\"The BBC has already said it was unclear as to whether it planned show the London Olympics 2012 in 3D. The numbers aren\'t there yet for it to make financial sense but that will change.\"</p><p>Young also reminds us that 3D TV is not (only) going to be driven by high-minded quality documentaries and cutting-edge sports and music festival coverage over the coming years, noting that 3D \"adult-entertainment, 3D-porn and gambling with \'live\' feeds will also feature next year.</p><p><strong>Coming to grips with 3D camera tech</strong></p><p>It is clear that broadcasters hope to push the provision of quality 3D TV content as one of the next major unique selling points to keep viewers watching their channels, or subscribing to their lucrative premium subscription packages. But what of the specific production issues and tech constraints that 3D TV directors currently face with the latest 3D camera tech?</p><p>\"Some of the key challenges facing 3D event projects are camera set-up and also user experience,\" argues Niall Duffy, managing director at media tech services specialists <a href=\"http://www.mediasmiths.com/\">Mediasmiths</a>. \"To begin with, 3D cameras are more expensive and complicated to set up which, in filming terms, means that typically there are a lot fewer camera angles than in 2D shoots, simply down to time constraints, meaning that the end product may feel less \'dynamic\' to the viewer. </p><p>\"The setting up of 3D cameras is still very cumbersome as well,\" adds Duffy,\"which can have an additional effect - for example, in golf broadcasts, when you may need multiple angles for each putt on the final hole, this can be severely limited by the 3D angles available.</p><p>\"There is still a scarcity of experience and capability when it comes to producing 3D content, but this is particularly felt in post-production and is simply down to the technology being relatively new and users not having had time to work with it yet.\"</p><p>In Duffy\'s expert opinion, he feels that once there is a strong volume of 3D content, in two to three years\' time, \"with content being generated more regularly the market will be primed and ready for 3D. In fact, the relatively high cost of producing 3D is ensuring that producers are committing to high-quality content created in the correct way. By the time the cost of production comes down, the techniques and technology to create good quality 3D content should be more widely known and available.\"</p><p>Finally, not all 3D content producers are convinced that broadcast 3D TV in the lounge is going to define the true future of 3D content, with Don Alvarez of 3D software design agency <a href=\"http://www.cynergysystems.com/\">Cynergy Systems</a>, telling us that, \"3D TV is completely driven by manufacturer push at the moment. Demand will follow, but content naturally lags device introduction and content is what really motivates demand in the long term.</p><p>\"We think the marking dollars focused on selling big 3D TVs are obscuring the real shift happening today towards 3D content viewed on smaller, personal displays. Whether it\'s a Nintendo 3DS, an LG Optimus 3D phone, or that rumoured upcoming 3D iPad, small format, personal displays let you go glasses-free at much more compelling price points than large living-room devices.\"</p><p>Clearly, not everybody in the TV or 3D content production industries think that this imminent proliferation of 3D-capable smartphones and mobile devices will be a threat to the production of quality 3D content, with Sky\'s John Cassyoffering his final word on the matter:</p><p>\"In terms of marketing Sky 3D, the most obvious difficulty is the fact that you cannot show a 3D image in print or on most 2D PC or TV screens. So the more Nintendo 3DSes and 3D-capable smartphones and tablets that are in customers\' hands over the next couple of years, the more opportunities 3D broadcasters such as Sky have to promote their 3D content.\" </p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16cb05a8/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/15cbde60/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Chdtv0Cwhy0Ethe0E3d0Erevolution0Eis0Ea0Emyth0E9642880Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Opinion: Why the 3D revolution is a myth</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16a121f3/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Chdtv0Cfreeview0Ehd0Eyour0Equestions0Eanswered0E630A7930Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Updated: Freeview HD: your questions answered</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16d92130/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Chdtv0C10A0Ebest0E370Einch0Elcd0Etvs0Ein0Ethe0Eworld0Etoday0E6568370Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: 10 best 37-inch LCD TVs in the world today</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16e72b0b/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Chdtv0C10A0Ebest0E420Einch0Ehd0Etvs0Ein0Ethe0Eworld0Etoday0E65780A30Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: 10 best 42-inch HD TVs in the world today</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=In+Depth%3A+The+future+of+3D+TV+content&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Ftelevision%2Fhdtv%2Fthe-future-of-3d-tv-content-981137%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=In+Depth%3A+The+future+of+3D+TV+content&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Ftelevision%2Fhdtv%2Fthe-future-of-3d-tv-content-981137%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108458548055/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/16cb05a8/kg/201-216-218-221-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108458548055/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/16cb05a8/kg/201-216-218-221-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~4/eP1aROWyj1k\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~3/eP1aROWyj1k/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/television\n',20895,NULL,'2011-07-20 11:50:00'),(159,'Review Roundup: This week\'s hottest reviews on TechRadar','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Canon%20PowerShot%20models/Powershot%20A800/Canon%20Powershot%20A800%20Product%20Shots/_MG_8527-200-200.jpg\" /><p>In this week\'s top reviews we\'ve reviewed several new cameras including the PowerShot A3200 IS and A800 from Canon as well as the latest PEN from Olympus. </p><p>We\'ve also looked at a high-performance Medion Core i7 laptop as well as the new super slim Lenovo X1. </p><p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/compact-cameras/canon-powershot-a800-977695/review\">Canon PowerShot A800 review</a></p><p>It\'s budget compact season in the world of Japanese giant, Canon! The latest snazzy snapper to hop off the cheap train is the Canon PowerShot A800. The A800 is Canon\'s entry-level compact camera, and as you\'d expect for 60 quid, it\'s a no-frills affair. No-frills doesn\'t necessarily mean dumbed-down, however, and there\'s actually quite a lot to like about this device. Indeed, the specifications belie the bargain-bucket price and include a 10-megapixel sensor, 3x optical zoom, Digic III processor and Smart Auto mode. At this end of the market, Canon is competing against camera phones, so does the A800 offer enough to persuade punters not to put the money towards an iPhone instead?</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/medion-erazer-x6813-978220/review\">Medion Erazer X6813 review</a></p><p>Like the MSI GT680 and the diminutive Alienware M11x, the 15.6-inch Medion Erazer X6813 laptop is designed to offer gamers the kind of frame rates they\'re used to on desktop machines, but on the go. Some notebooks compromise practicality for sheer performance, but the Medion boasts both practicality and power. Like MSI\'s GT680, the GPU that Medion has opted for with the Erazer X6813 is Nvidia\'s GeForce GTX 460M and it provides a lot of gaming poke for your money. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo ThinkPad X1 review</a></p><p>When we first laid hands on the Lenovo ThinkPad X1, we were impressed. The conventional plain black design remains, but the firm body measures just 27mm at its thickest point and weighs a mere 1.8kg, making it effortlessly portable. In typical ThinkPad style, it\'s also one of the most rugged ultra-portables we\'ve seen. Sure, the X1 lacks the immediate beauty of the Samsung 9 Series or Apple MacBook Air, but it\'s solidly built in all areas, from the impressively tough lid to the rubberised frame and it performs well, too. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/compact-cameras/canon-powershot-a3200-is-977697/review\">Canon PowerShot A3200 IS review</a></p><p>The second silly season snapper off the canon conveyor belt is the budget PowerShot A3200 IS. Costing £40 more than the A800 above, it comes with image stabilisation. You get a lot more besides, including a 14.1-megapixel sensor, 5x optical zoom, 720p HD video recording, better-looking slimmer metal case, 5x optical zoom and Advanced Scene Detection modes. The A3200 is an upgrade of the A3100 IS camera, which had 12.1 megapixels, 4 x optical zoom lacked HD video capability. So are these extra features worth the upgrade? We think it is – the A3200 is a fantastic little camera, offering decent image quality and good battery life and a sturdy compact design.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/hands-on-olympus-pen-e-pl3-review-977812\">Olympus PEN E-PL3 review</a></p><p>The new PEN E-PL3 slots into the middle of the new Olympus PEN range, a halfway house between its older brother, the E-P3 and its smaller sibling, the E-PM1 (PEN mini). The Lite uses the same 12-million pixel sensor and 35 point autofocus system as the other models in the new line-up, so the main differences come in the way of its shape and a few minor tweaks in the operation and menu of the camera. Further testing is required when we get our hands on a final production model, but the PEN E-PL3 seems to handle most lighting and exposure conditions well.</p><p><img alt=\"Olympus pen\"

row, with the price increases hitting the active shutter market.</p><p>According to a study by \'global information\' company IHS, active shutter tech seems to be more of a premium of late, which means the price gap between this technology and passive is shrinking.</p><p>\"The biggest pricing increases for flat-panel televisions last month were among the new 3D models employing active shutter glasses, the most popular type of three-dimensional set on the market today,\" explained Riddhi Patel, IHS television systems and retail services director. </p><p>\"There is an increasing number of models with 3D capability in the product mix that have higher than average prices. These sets drove price increases for the entire flat-panel television market in the United States in June.\" </p><p><strong>Passive aggressive</strong></p><p>What\'s interesting is that active shutter TVs hold pretty much the same technology inside them as high-end 2D TVs. The added cost is within the glasses and the IR sensor, which is sold separately.</p><p>Passive TVs on the other hand are costlier to make, as the screen needs special treatment for the passive glasses to work.</p><p>It\'s a surprise, then, that passive TVs are now seen as the cheaper 3D alternative. The IHS is saying that in the 40- to 49-inch range, passive TVs are now cheaper by 9 per cent. This rises to 14 per cent when you look at TVs 50 inches and above.</p><p>This cheapening of passive TVs does seem to be aggressive pricing by LG and likes to get the technology in the market, much like Sony and Samsung did in the UK before Christmas.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16aeab46/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/1692c8cf/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cvideo0Etelevision0Ebuyer0Es0Eguide0E9775710Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Video: Television buyer\'s guide</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/1698de15/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cmore0Ethan0E10A0Eof0Enew0Etv0Es0E3d0Eenabled0Eby0Eend0Eof0E20A110E9780A710Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">More than 10% of new TV\'s 3D-enabled by end of 2011</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/169f30e9/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Csony0E3d0Eexperience0Elaunches0Efor0Ebravia0Esmart0Etvs0E9785450Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Sony 3D Experience launches for Bravia smart TVs</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16d8900a/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Clg0Eto0Elaunch0Ea0E55in0Eoled0Etv0Ein0E20A120E9818750Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">LG to launch a 55in OLED TV in 2012</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16ef8a2b/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cfreesat0Ebegins0Eitv0Eplayer0Eroll0Eout0E9837390Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Freesat begins ITV Player roll out</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=3D+TV+prices+on+the+rise&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Ftelevision%2F3d-tv-prices-on-the-rise-979331%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=3D+TV+prices+on+the+rise&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Ftelevision%2F3d-tv-prices-on-the-rise-979331%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108286733647/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/16aeab46/kg/201-253-259-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108286733647/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/16aeab46/kg/201-253-259-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~4/uLLxMFvbekw\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~3/uLLxMFvbekw/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/television\n',4302,NULL,'2011-07-15 09:57:00'),(161,'Updated: Freeview HD: your questions answered','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/home-entertainment/tv/images/FVHD_logo2%20-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Millions of homes in the UK currently have HD TV sets but still only watch television in standard definition. This is all changing, with the arrival of Freeview HD.</p><p>Freeview HD is a service that now provides not only the same standard definition channels that Freeview currently hosts, but also high-definition offerings from the BBC, Channel 4 and ITV.</p><p>These new high-def channels are free to view, so there is no subscription necessary. The only cost comes from the fact that anyone wanting to view the new service will have to buy a new Freeview HD-compatible set-top box or a Freeview HD TV with a DVB-T2 tuner to decode the HD transmissions.</p><p>Old Freeview (DVB-T) tuners – in both televisions and set-top boxes – can\'t decode Freeview HD signals and can only receive the existing standard definition channels.</p><h4>What is Freeview HD?</h4><p>Broadcasters bundle the Freeview TV channels into six groups, or multiplexes, with each one being transmitted separately on a slightly different frequency. This is why in areas of poor reception, you can sometimes only receive a random collection of channels – it\'s common with indoor aerials to not be able to receive all six of the multiplexes perfectly.</p><p>With Freeview HD, the new HD channels took over one of these six multiplexes, and the channels that were in that multiplex before were distributed across the other five. This is why during the switchover many people have had to retune their standard Freeview TVs and boxes multiple times, with seemingly little effect. It\'s all about reshuffling the existing channels to make room for the new HD content.</p><p>Freeview HD set-top boxes and TVs are able to tune into and play back the five standard definition DVB-T multiplexes, and of course, the renewed sixth DVB-T2 multiplex. This means that all current standard Freeview equipment will continue to function perfectly well with the SD channels, while only DVB-T2 tuners will be able to see the HD channels.</p><h4>Why should I care about watching TV in HD?</h4><p>Freeview HD is transmitted at a higher bitrate than standard Freeview channels. This means the picture arrives at a higher resolution and contains more detail, while the audio is often better too.</p><p>Standard definition pictures were designed primarily for smaller CRT televisions. Modern day HD TVs are much bigger, and are capable of displaying more pixels. So if you\'ve paid for an HD TV but aren\'t able to receive HD pictures, you\'re missing out.</p><h4>What channels are available in HD?</h4><p>Currently there are four channels available in high definition on Freeview HD. These are:</p><ul><li><strong>BBC One HD</strong> (channel 50). Exactly the same as BBC One, except it\'s in high definition</li><li><strong>ITV1 HD</strong> (channel 51). Exactly the same as ITV1, except it\'s in high definition</li><li><strong>Channel 4 HD</strong> (channel 52). Exactly the same as Channel 4, except it\'s in high definition</li><li><strong>BBC HD</strong> (channel 54). An assortment of BBC content in HD. Sometimes you\'ll get an HD simulcast with BBC 2, at other times you\'ll get repeats in HD.</li><li><strong>More HD channels will appear over time - your box will tell you when to retune!</strong></li></ul><p>The three HD simulcast channels contain a mix of HD and upscaled content. Not all shows are recorded in HD yet, so those that aren\'t are upscaled to a higher resolution. You can check to see what resolution you\'re watching by pressing the \'<strong>i</strong>\' button on your remote control.</p><h4>Can I get Freeview HD?</h4><p>Most areas in the UK can now receive the DVB-T2 signal, but there are some regions that are a little behind. You can find out for sure by entering your postcode on the official <a href=\"http://www.freeview.co.uk/availability/main/indexhd\">Freeview HD coverage checker</a>.</p><h4>How do I get Freeview HD?</h4><p>To watch Freeview HD signals you\'ll need a device capable of decoding the DVB-T2 signal. That\'ll either be a simple Freeview HD tuner (set-top box), a Freeview+ HD PVR box (which will allow you to record shows as well as pause and rewind live TV) or a new TV with a DVB-T2 tuner built-in.</p><p>You shouldn\'t need to buy a new aerial, because even a basic indoor aerial is capable of picking up the signal, providing the signal is strong enough. This is partially because Freeview HD is compressed using MPEG-4 instead of the less efficient MPEG-2. If you can already receive a good Freeview signal, you shouldn\'t experience any reception issues.</p><h4>Our favourite Freeview HD equipment:</h4><p>The first Freeview HD box was the Humax HD-FOX T2. It cost £170 on launch but since then it\'s had a number of firmware updates to include BBC iPlayer access and PVR-like recording functionality. It\'s also available for under £80.</p><p>There are lots of options available now, here are a few good\'uns to get you started:</p><p><strong>Freeview HD boxes:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/icecrypt-t2200-690460/review\">Icecrypt T2200</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/sharp-tu-t2-693286/review\">Sharp TU-U2</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/triax-t2-hd-115-911924/review\">Triax T2-HD 115</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/manhattan-plaza-hdt-700-713397/review\">Manhattan Plaza HDT-700</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/humax-hd-fox-t2-668320/review\">Humax HD-FOX T2</a></li></ul><p><strong>Freeview+ HD PVRs/recorders:</strong></p><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-recorders/sharp-tut2hr32-707601/review\">Sharp TU-T2HR32</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-recorders/humax-hdr-fox-t2-708548/review\">Humax HDR-FOX T2</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-recorders/philips-hdt8520-716278/review\">Philips HDT8520</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-recorders/tvonics-dtr-hd500-718461/review\">TVonics DTR-HD500</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-recorders/icecrypt-t2400-909010/review\">Icecrypt T2400</a></li></ul><h4>What other HD broadcasts are available?</h4><p><strong>Freesat: </strong>Freeview HD isn\'t the only source of free HD TV content in the UK. There\'s also Freesat, which is very similar but comes into your home via a satellite dish instead of a TV aerial. Freesat has no subscription charge, so again the only cost is in buying a box or a compatible TV, and a satellite dish, if you don\'t have one already.</p><p>Freesat also has more HD content available, so if you\'re an HD enthusiast looking to upgrade, Freesat might be a better option.</p><p><strong>Sky+HD:</strong> If you\'re happy to buy a TV subscription, you could also pay for Sky+HD.</p><p><strong>Virgin Media:</strong> Virgin Media also has plenty of HD channels – but again, there are subscription charges at work here.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

cent of new televisions being made will be 3D ready by the end of 2011, according to the five key manufacturers of panels. </p><p>Sharp, Samsung, LG Display, AU Optronics (AUO) and Chimei Innolux

of their panels to be 3D capable, while AUO are aiming for 10 per cent. </p><p>The more familiar names to consumers – Sharp, LG and Samsung – are all setting their targets at between the two. </p><p><strong>Price benefits</strong></p><p>The competition between passive and active shutter glasses is being seen within the industry as a battle which will ultimately drive prices down for the consumer. </p><p>With the amount of 3D content being produced increasingly hugely, the desire for a 3D television is clearly on the rise, despite some deep-seated doubts from consumers in the technology. </p><p>With the major television manufacturers all backing 3D, albeit with a split between active and passive, the technology is likely to become a familiar site in new televisions, in the same way as HD is now more often present than not in the latest screens. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/1698de15/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div

over active versus passive 3D TVs rages on, it could be all but obliterated by the development of an autostereoscopic television which does away with the glasses altogether. </p><p>Some manufacturers, like <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/toshiba-glasses-free-3d-coming-to-europe-in-2012-941046\">Toshiba</a>, have committed to rushing out a glasses-free 3D TV as early as 2012, but Panasonic has now said that it\'ll be at least five years before it has an auto-stereoscopic 3D set on the market. </p><p>Speaking at Intellect\'s Consumer Electronics 2011 show, Panasonic\'s marketing manager Andrew Denham explained why: \"Its not there yet. The physics of it – you can\'t get there without hurting the 2D experience at the moment.\" </p><p><strong>Lenticular lentils</strong></p><p>While <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/hdtv/philips-to-launch-glasses-free-3d-tv-in-2013-713951\">Philips, which will launch an auto-stereoscopic set in 2013</a>, and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/hands-on-toshiba-glasses-free-3d-tv-review-919901\">Toshiba</a> are relying on lenticular displays (which show two sets of the same image, one for each eye, which your brain then puts together), Panasonic won\'t be going that route. </p><p>The problem is that glasses-free 3D, like that of the Nintendo 3DS and smartphones like the HTC Evo 3D, is that it requires you find a sweetspot and hold your head there. Fine when using a mobile device, but not so brilliant for watching a 40-inch TV attached to the wall. </p><p>\"It\'s getting better,\" said Denham. \"But we won\'t solve it with lenticular displays. Within five years we\'ll see it [glasses-free 3D TV] in the consumer market.\" </p><p>The company is no doubt keen to get it right, particularly given that its range of active-shutter TVs require people to buy glasses that cost upwards of £80. </p><p>When asked if it was sustainable for the company to continue bundling multiple pairs of glasses with each TV sold, Denham replied, \"Clearly not.\" </p><p><img alt=\"3DGlasses\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20292/PCP292.feat3.3d_glasses-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>But is the advent of glasses-free 3D TVs hindering uptake of the current crop? </p><p>\"We don\'t think so,\" said Denham. What could be hindering it, though, is the <a href=\"http://3dradar.techradar.com/3d-tech/panasonic-hollywood-damaged-3d-05-07-2011\">damage Hollywood has done</a> with its shoddy 2D to 3D conversions. </p><p>\"The film industry has accelerated the time to market and that has created concerns over quality. But that will subside; we\'re all learning and moving to higher quality content. It\'s a chicken and egg situation, though – but we\'re doing our part in seeding enthusiasm for 3D TV.\" </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/1675ea5a/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/1698de15/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cmore0Ethan0E10A0Eof0Enew0Etv0Es0E3d0Eenabled0Eby0Eend0Eof0E20A110E9780A710Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">More than 10% of new TV\'s 3D-enabled by end of 2011</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/169f30e9/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Csony0E3d0Eexperience0Elaunches0Efor0Ebravia0Esmart0Etvs0E9785450Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Sony 3D Experience launches for Bravia smart TVs</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16aeab46/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0C3d0Etv0Eprices0Eon0Ethe0Erise0E9793310Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">3D TV prices on the rise</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16d8900a/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Clg0Eto0Elaunch0Ea0E55in0Eoled0Etv0Ein0E20A120E9818750Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">LG to launch a 55in OLED TV in 2012</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415087/s/16ef8a2b/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ctelevision0Cfreesat0Ebegins0Eitv0Eplayer0Eroll0Eout0E9837390Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewstelevi/story01.htm\">Freesat begins ITV Player roll out</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Panasonic%3A+glasses-free+3D+TV+%27within+five+years%27&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Ftelevision%2Fpanasonic-glasses-free-3d-tv-within-five-years--975392%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Panasonic%3A+glasses-free+3D+TV+%27within+five+years%27&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Ftelevision%2Fpanasonic-glasses-free-3d-tv-within-five-years--975392%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewstelevi\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106216639432/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/1675ea5a/kg/201-216-221-253-259-260/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106216639432/u/49/f/415087/c/669/s/1675ea5a/kg/201-216-221-253-259-260/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~4/_7ucAdyxFn4\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/television-news/~3/_7ucAdyxFn4/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/television\n',5605,NULL,'2011-07-06 10:08:00'),(169,'Virgin Media announces Spotify partnership','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/internet-and-broadband/images/spotify_pic-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Virgin Media has confirmed that it has sealed a partnership with music streaming giant Spotify. </p><p>The deal has <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/virgin-media-responds-to-spotify-partnership-rumours-973045\">been on the cards</a> for some time, and the cable company has now confirmed that it has signed up Spotify to run across \'multiple services\'. </p><p>The Spotify service on Virgin Media will offer up over 13 million tracks for Virgin Media customers either through the internet, their mobiles or on their televisions. </p><p>With a UK launch date set in \'the coming months\', Virgin Media has set out a plan to offer the service to new and existing customers through a range of special offers. </p><p><strong>Premium offer</strong></p><p>That will apparently include Spotify Unlimited and Spotify Premium, with the latter offering download of tracks for playback on offline devices.</p><p>Jon James, executive director of broadband at Virgin Media, said: \"We are delighted to have united the Virgin Media brand with the world\'s best music service. </p><p>\"Spotify will help our customers to fill their world with music, whether it\'s at home or on the go, and provide a unique way to get even more out of Virgin Media\'s leading digital services.\"</p><p>Andreas Liffgarden, director of business development at Spotify, added: \"By teaming up with Virgin Media we\'re giving millions more people across the UK the chance to enjoy all the world\'s music at their fingertips, however they choose to listen to it -

The first is to add an additional wi-fi access point if there are \'black spots\' in your home. Here, an Ethernet cable is run from your router to where the additional coverage is required. </p><p>In the second mode, two WLAE-AG300Ns act as a wireless \'bridge\' between two existing wired networks. </p><p>Finally, there\'s the ability to connect non wi-fi devices to a wireless network, by running an Ethernet cable from the WLAE-AG300N to the device. </p><p>The new 802.11n/a 5GHz band is supported, in addition to the established 802.11a/g and 11b (2.4GHz) modes. The former band is far less congested and claims data transfer rates as high as 300Mbps. </p><p>Two Ethernet ports ensure that a pair of networked devices can be simultaneously connected and thus converted to wireless operation. It\'s also very easy to use and configure and supports DHCP. </p><p>A web interface (which would be accessible to Mac and Linux users) allows you to subsequently change parameters including SSID/ network name, encryption mode (WEP, TKIP and AES are all supported, as the ability to enter your own key) and radio mode. </p><p>Another good feature is a technology known as AOSS (AirStation One-Touch Secure System) which aims to speed up the setup of secure wireless connections. We had no problems with performance, either. Streamed audio and video alike were free of glitches. </p><p>Initially, the WLAE-AG300N will set the radio mode automatically using DFS (Dynamic Frequency Selection) to determine the best band and channel. Where there is a lot of 2.4GHz wireless activity, it might select a 5GHz channel. If this occurs, you won\'t discover the Buffalo access point with older gear. But you can easily fix this via the web interface. </p><p>Few devices support AOSS, only the newer Nintendo hand-held consoles, the Wii, PSPs running newer firmware and the PS3.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/network-adapters\">Read more network adapter reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16f36c38/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Buffalo+AirStation+WLAE-AG300N&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fnetworking-and-wi-fi%2Fnetwork-adapters%2Fbuffalo-airstation-wlae-ag300n-982884%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Buffalo+AirStation+WLAE-AG300N&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fnetworking-and-wi-fi%2Fnetwork-adapters%2Fbuffalo-airstation-wlae-ag300n-982884%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877852038/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16f36c38/kg/253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877852038/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16f36c38/kg/253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/cuJjj9eb35I\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/cuJjj9eb35I/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',3694,NULL,'2011-07-27 09:30:00');

TV you\'ll be watching, these XpanD glasses are good bet-hedgers. </p><p>XpanD will be launching a new range (the X104) with support for Bluetooth as well as the radio system favoured by Panasonic. </p><p>The Xpand 3D glasses are well-made and are fairly easy to install. A simple programming system, based around a single button and LED, enables you to tell the glasses which TV you\'re using. </p><p>In its set-up mode, the brand is selected cyclically by pressing the button. The number of LED \'flashes\' corresponds to a specific TV brand; if it\'s correct, press nothing for 30 seconds and you\'re done. Once set, your choice is remembered until you change it. </p><p>The picture quality and comfort level are on par with the brands\' own glasses in terms of light-attenuation, flicker, separation and so on. </p><p>They wrap around existing spectacles and have replaceable nose-pieces (three are supplied). </p><p> These are upgradable for new models of TV via a dealer only. Compatibility with Sony, JVC and Sharp wasn\'t claimed for our sample, but the website now lists these brands.</p><p>However, they didn\'t work with a <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs/samsung-ue55d8000-931927/review\">Samsung UE55D8000</a>.

Modern units, such as the ReadyNAS Ultra 4 featured here, are also capable of streaming any multimedia files stored on them to any Smart device that can accept them. </p><p>The four drive bays of the heavy and massively-built ReadyNAS Ultra 4 can each accommodate 2TB drives and so a combined total of 8TB is possible – that\'s an awful lot of video, photos and music. </p><p>The Netgear ReadyNAS Ultra 4 supports various implementations of RAID technology, which trades off available capacity against protection for your data. If one of the drives fails, you should be able to recover your files. Features like \'RAIDar\' and \'X-RAID 2\' help you make the most of this useful feature. </p><p>Powered by a dual-core 1.6GHz Intel Atom processor, it\'s speedy and responsive. The onboard DLNA 1.5 media server worked well with a variety of networked players. Even multiple full HD video streams were glitch-free. </p><p>Useful multimedia features include a Squeezebox server and iTunes compatibility. As far as computers are concerned, this NAS is equally at home with Windows and MacOS. And it will, of course, also work with Linux. </p><p>Also, if you\'re interested in adding more functionality, you can get Applets (such as BitTorrent) which can be downloaded from the Netgear website. </p><p>On the down-side, I couldn\'t get it to join my Windows workgroup, as it has a space in its name and the Ultra 4 didn\'t like that, forcing me to either create a separate workgroup, or rename the existing one (and change the settings of every connected device). Thankfully, Netgear confirmed the bug and fixed it with a firmware release. </p><p>The (secure) web interface may be powerful, but every time it\'s accessed with Windows Internet Explorer 8 a \'certificate error\' warning is displayed. But this can be ignored. </p><p>Sadly, only 3.5-inch drives are supported, while 2.5-inch models run quieter and consume less power.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/network-attached-storage-nas-\">Read more NAS drive reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16f33c1b/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Netgear+ReadyNAS+Ultra+4&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fnetworking-and-wi-fi%2Fnetwork-attached-storage-nas-%2Fnetgear-readynas-ultra-4-982841%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Netgear+ReadyNAS+Ultra+4&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fnetworking-and-wi-fi%2Fnetwork-attached-storage-nas-%2Fnetgear-readynas-ultra-4-982841%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877846701/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16f33c1b/kg/216-239-253-258-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877846701/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16f33c1b/kg/216-239-253-258-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/LbM9hLLAVJ0\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/LbM9hLLAVJ0/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',3822,NULL,'2011-07-27 08:30:00'),(174,'Review: Sony VAIO Z Series','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/Sony%20VAIO%20Z%20Series/Sony%20VAIO%20VPC-Z21V9E%20Front%20Angled-200-200.jpg\" /><p>The old cliché states that good things come in small packages, which means that chicken nuggets, dead hedgehogs and Peter Andre\'s head are all apparently \'good things\'. However, we have to agree with this logic when it\'s applied to Sony\'s latest VAIO Z Series ultra-portable laptop, the Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E.</p><p>Despite being cursed by a name that\'s less catchy than an N-Dubz tune, this is an excellent little 13.1-inch PC laptop that we\'d happily use as our everyday computer. </p><p>That is, if we happened to have a spare couple of grand knocking around, priced as it is at £2,699.</p><p>We\'ve seen a lot of ultra-portables lately, from the sleek and sexy <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-900xsa-942065/review\">Samsung 900XSA</a> to the business-oriented <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo ThinkPad X1</a>. It\'s impressive how much power you can now cram into a tiny frame, ably demonstrated by the new <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-apple-macbook-air-2011-review-981684\">Apple MacBook Air 2011</a>, which squeezes Intel\'s Sandy Bridge technology into something as thin as your finger.</p><p>The 13.1-inch Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E also manages this feat. It\'s a little chunkier than the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-apple-macbook-air-2011-review-981684\">Apple MacBook Air 2011</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-900xsa-942065/review\">Samsung 9 Series</a>, but at 20mm it\'s still a slender machine. Best of all, it weighs just 1.18kg – less than most netbooks we\'ve used.</p><p><img alt=\"Sony vaio vpc-z21v9e\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/Sony%20VAIO%20Z%20Series/Sony%20VAIO%20VPC-Z21V9E%20With%20Dock-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Sony has stuck with its traditional all-black design, which is a shame. We definitely prefer the brushed chrome body of the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-900xsa-942065/review\">Samsung 900XSA</a>, and the glossy white design of the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-apple-macbook-air-2011-review-981684\">Apple MacBook Air</a>. The carbon fibre build is solid at least, although the lid does feel rather fragile, a problem we\'ve noticed with a few VAIOs lately. We wouldn\'t recommend placing anything on top of the VAIO VPC-Z21V9E, just in case.</p><p>We initially had mixed feelings over the keyboard, which has the shallowest travel we\'ve ever experienced. When the keys are hit they barely move, akin to typing on a virtual keyboard on a tablet. However, we were used to it after just a few minutes. The board is tilted slightly when the lid is lifted, as the rear is pushed upwards. This makes typing comfortable, even over prolonged periods.</p><p>Each key protrudes through its own hole cut in the chassis, isolation-style. The distance between keys makes it easier to touch type, but there are no open gaps for crumbs to infiltrate the VAIO Z Series laptop\'s precious innards. A subtle backlighting effect makes the keys glow in the dark, so you can bash out that novel at 3am when inspiration strikes without having to turn on the lights.</p><p>Despite the compact body, the keys are generally well sized. Even the arrow keys (often the first casualties) haven\'t suffered, although the Shift keys are rather thin. This didn\'t bother us too much, because we have tiny girl fingers anyway.</p><p>However, the VAIO VPC-Z21V9E\'s touchpad is cramped, meaning you\'ll be lifting your finger often when sweeping the cursor across the screen. We like the textured surface, and the mouse buttons are firm.</p><p>Above the keyboard, you\'ll find a wireless networking on/off switch, as well as the usual Assist, VAIO and Web shortcut buttons. These allow you to surf the web, diagnose issues and fiddle with power settings in an instant.</p><p><img alt=\"Sony vaio vpc-z21v9e\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/Sony%20VAIO%20Z%20Series/Sony%20VAIO%20VPC-Z21V9E%20Front%20straight-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>One thing we always expect from Sony\'s VAIO laptops is a gorgeous screen, and the VAIO VPC-Z21V9E doesn\'t disappoint. The 13.1-inch screen has a matt TFT finish, so there are no pesky reflections when you\'re working outside. </p><p>Despite the lack of gloss, we were struck by how realistic our photos appeared. Colours are rich and vibrant, helped by the excellent brightness levels.</p><p>On a display this size, we\'d hope for a 1366 x 768 (WXGA) resolution as the minimum. Sony has gone one further, and the VAIO VPC-Z21V9E has a crisp 1600 x 900 (WXGA++) resolution, with images looking super sharp. Even the tiniest fonts are easy to make out, if your eyesight can cope.</p><p>A 256GB solid state drive (SSD) gives you reasonable space for carrying around files and media, but there\'s no built-in DVD drive. </p><p><img alt=\"Sony vaio vpc-z21v9e dock\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/Sony%20VAIO%20Z%20Series/Sony%20VAIO%20VPC-Z21V9E%20dock-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>However, one of the funky new features of this VAIO Z Series is the docking station, which plugs into the laptop\'s power and USB port, and is propped upright by the included stand. This not only adds an optical drive, it also gives you two more USB ports (one of them USB 3.0), extra VGA and HDMI ports, and another Ethernet port. Sony has also squeezed in a dedicated GPU – but more on that later.</p><p>While Sony could have built an optical drive into the VAIO VPC-Z21V9E\'s body, as it did with previous models, this would have bulked up the laptop. By separating it, you can carry the drive around only when needed. The extra ports are a great addition, especially as there are only two USB ports on the actual machine.</p><p>Like the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo ThinkPad X1</a>, this laptop also has a built-in fingerprint scanner for extra security. If you\'re carrying around confidential documents and want to protect them with more than a password, this is a great alternative.</p><p><strong><img alt=\"Sony vaio vpc-z21v9e\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/Sony%20VAIO%20Z%20Series/Sony%20VAIO%20VPC-Z21V9E%20With%20Dock-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><br /></strong></p><p>Many of the ultra-portable laptops we\'ve seen lately are powered by Intel\'s latest Sandy Bridge Core i5 processors. Compared to the low-voltage ultra-portables of yesteryear, these things will last you a long time, which is just what you want when you\'re splashing out over a grand on a new laptop.</p><p>Sony has upped the game with an Intel Core i7 2620M processor, running at 2.7GHz, backed up by a whopping 8GB of RAM. In our benchmark tests, the VAIO VPC-Z21V9E ruled over all of its brethren. </p><p>This laptop can run anything you throw at it, and response times are almost instant. We rarely waited more than a couple of seconds for a piece of software to load up, which is perfect for the more impatient user.</p><p>As with many ultra-portables, the Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E has no built-in dedicated graphics. The Sandy Bridge chipset is used to render images instead. </p><p>Thankfully, Intel\'s latest processors are far more adept at graphical wizardry than the older models, and you can comfortably enjoy HD films, edit your photos and even mess around with home movies using basic video editing software. Of course, the latest games will either struggle a lot or be completely unplayable.</p><p><img alt=\"Sony vaio vpc-z21v9e\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/Sony%20VAIO%20Z%20Series/Sony%20VAIO%20VPC-Z21V9E%20Front%20straight-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>However, plug the Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E into the docking station and you can make full use of the dock\'s AMD Radeon HD 6650M GPU. With the docking station connected, our benchmark scores using 3D Mark doubled. We found that even the newest computer games ran smoothly, with no frame rate issues at all. </p><p>Unfortunately, we did notice that the cooling fans went into overdrive when we started playing. A constant blast of hot air shoots out of the left side, and the noise is intrusive if you\'re in a quiet environment.</p><p>Using these high-powered Intel processors has killed the battery life of recent ultra-portables, with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo ThinkPad X1</a> surviving for just 107 minutes in our tests, and the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/983546\">HP ProBook 5330m</a> managing a slightly more respectable 139 minutes.</p><p>We ran the Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E through the same process, firing up an HD video and seeing how long it could last on a single charge. Our expectations were low, yet the VAIO lasted an impressive 225 minutes before dying. Stick to word processing and you get almost five hours.</p><p><strong>Benchmarks</strong><br />Cinebench – 11457<br />3D Mark \'06 – 8626 / 4958<br />Battery Eater \'05 – 225 minutes</p><p><img alt=\"Sony vaio vpc-z21v9e\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/Sony%20VAIO%20Z%20Series/Sony%20VAIO%20VPC-Z21V9E%20Front%20Angled-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>As big fans of Sony\'s previous VAIO Z Series models, such as the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/sony-vaio-z-series-vpcz13m9e-944479/review\">VPC-Z13M9E</a>, we had high hopes for the VAIO VPC-Z21V9E. </p><p>With its Sandy Bridge Core i7 processor, ultra-thin body and unique docking station, it does everything right on paper. But did it meet expectations, and how does it compare to the competition?</p><p><strong>We liked</strong></p><p>As expected, the Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E smashed the competition when it came to performance. You\'ve got enough power to run any software you can think of, and you certainly won\'t need to upgrade any time soon.</p><p>Thankfully, portability doesn\'t suffer. Almost four hours of battery life when watching movies is a tremendous result, while the slim and ridiculously light frame will slip into almost any bag.</p><p><img alt=\"Sony vaio vpc-z21v9e dock\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/Sony%20VAIO%20Z%20Series/Sony%20VAIO%20VPC-Z21V9E%20dock-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you\'re not on the move, you can connect the Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E to its docking station. This gives you loads more ports, a slot-loading DVD drive and a dedicated AMD graphics card, so you can play the latest games.</p><p>Both games and movies look incredible on the 13.3-inch TFT screen, which is sharp, bright and vibrant. The lack of gloss means you can work outside, without being hampered by reflections.</p><p><strong>We disliked</strong></p><p>The keyboard has the shallowest travel of any laptop we\'ve tested, with the keys barely moving when hit. However, aside from this it\'s a well-designed board that\'s comfortable to use. The touchpad is cramped, but sensitive.</p><p>Our only other gripe is the design. After using glamorous portables such as the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-900xsa-942065/review\">Samsung 9 Series</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/apple/hands-on-apple-macbook-air-2011-review-981684\">Apple MacBook Air</a>, we were uninspired by the plain black design of the Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E.

The HP ProBook 5330m packs Intel Sandy Bridge technology into a thin 28mm aluminium chassis, and the result is a heady mix of power and portability.</p><p>If you\'re constantly on the move, you\'ll love that slender build. This portable is just as thin as <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo\'s ThinkPad X1</a>, and only a little chunkier than the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/samsung-900xsa-942065/review\">Samsung 9000 Series</a> and new <a href=\"http://feeds2.feedburner.com/techradar/link%20http://www.techradar.com/983369\">Sony VAIO VPC-Z21V9E</a>. </p><p>With a compact 13.3-inch screen, the HP ProBook 5330m slips into almost any backpack or carrier you might own. It won\'t weigh you down on lengthy trips either, thanks to the 1.9kg frame.</p><p>Yet despite the slim and light build, the HP ProBook 5330m is very well put together. The lid is sturdy, with only minor flex in the centre, and firmly connected via two solid hinges. We also struggled to find any weak spots in the two-piece chassis, which endured some severe pounding from our chunky fingers and came off no worse for wear.</p><p><img alt=\"HP probook 5330m\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/HP%20ProBook%205330m/HP%20ProBook%205330m%20Front%20Angle-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Unfortunately the HP ProBook 5330m\'s appearance caused split opinions at TechRadar. Some felt the body was rather boxy and plain, while others warmed to the almost retro design. Make up your own mind on that one.</p><p>The keyboard fills a good chunk of the chassis and is laid out in the popular \'isolation-style\' design (each key pokes up through a separate hole in the chassis, which spreads them out). </p><p>The keys are surprisingly well-sized, despite the HP ProBook 5330m\'s compact chassis, so touch typing is a quick and comfortable experience. Even the arrow keys aren\'t too cramped compared to some, although the Enter key is relegated to a single row high.</p><p>However, the travel of the keys is rather shallow when they\'re hit, and we found the occasional button press didn\'t register. A particular offender, for some reason, was the \'o\' key. Reading back over this review, we found lots of instances of \'laptp\' and \'PrBok\'. It\'s not a massive issue, but can be annoying when doing internet searches.</p><p>The touchpad is perfect, thankfully. The smooth surface covers a wide area, with raised mouse buttons that make them easy to click. It\'s surprisingly common for a touchpad to be duff, but the HP ProBook 5330m\'s is a winner.</p><p><img alt=\"HP probook 5330m\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/HP%20ProBook%205330m/HP%20ProBook%205330m%20Front%20Angle-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>All business laptops place an emphasis on security, so if a chav child makes off with your precious portable, they can\'t access your fantastic plans for a space car powered by scotch eggs.</p><p>The HP ProBook 5330m is no exception, with a built-in fingerprint scanner. We see this feature on almost every modern business machine, and it\'s a good, quick alternative to remembering a number of complex passwords. </p><p>You also get HP\'s ProtectTools software suite, which helps you to manage your security settings, encrypt your hard drive and back up your mega-important files.</p><p>In fact, that\'s just one of the many tools HP pre-installs on its laptops. You also get the likes of HP Power Assistant, which helps you manage your power settings to get maximum performance or battery life, and HP QuickWeb, which gives you near-instant access to the web without having to boot up Windows.</p><p>More experienced users will no doubt refer to these software suites as \'crapware\' and uninstall them on sight, which is fair enough. However, if the HP ProBook 5330m is your first laptop, you\'ll likely get some benefit from these packages.</p><p><img alt=\"HP probook 5330m\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/HP%20ProBook%205330m/HP%20ProBook%205330m%20Front-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Like the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo ThinkPad X1</a>, there\'s no optical drive built into the HP ProBook 5330m. In this digital age there\'s less and less reason to carry sacks of CDs and DVDs around with you, so this shouldn\'t pose a problem. </p><p>The 500GB hard drive means you\'ll have plenty of space to cart around your media as well as your files and applications.</p><p>We streamed some HD content over the interweb and sat back to enjoy a film on the bright 13.3-inch screen. Despite using a matt TFT display, movies look fantastic. The HP ProBook 5330m plays HD video perfectly and images are crisp, thanks to the 1366 x 768 WXGA resolution. </p><p>Even sound quality impresses through the built-in Beats speakers. Top volume leaves a little to be desired, but the speakers pack more of a punch than the usual tinny efforts.</p><p>If you want to make use of a larger screen or projector, you have VGA and HDMI connections. You also get two USB ports and an eSATA port that doubles as a third USB connection.</p><p><img alt=\"HP probook 5330m\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/HP%20ProBook%205330m/HP%20ProBook%205330m%20Front-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>As expected, the HP ProBook 5330m features Intel\'s latest technology, the Sandy Bridge processor. It\'s a Core i5 2520M running at 2.5GHz, and combined with 4GB of RAM, it turned in one of the best ultra-portable benchmarking performances of recent times.</p><p>While the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo ThinkPad X1</a> just inched ahead, the HP ProBook 5330m is more than capable of running any software you throw at it. Performance is strong enough to last you years, so you won\'t need to upgrade to a newer model any time soon.</p><p>Unless, that is, you suddenly develop a burning need to run complex video editing software or play the latest games. </p><p>The HP ProBook 5330m uses the Sandy Bridge architecture\'s built-in GPU to render images, and while the second-generation Core i5 processors are much more capable than their elder brethren, they\'re still limited compared to a machine with dedicated graphics.</p><p>So while you can comfortably play around with your photos and enjoy HD films, anything more complicated will likely result in shonky, shuddering performance. </p><p><img alt=\"HP probook 5330m\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/HP%20ProBook%205330m/HP%20ProBook%205330m%20Front%20Angle-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>For instance, our 3D Mark benchmarking software struggled when it came to rendering cutscenes. Frame rates of 10fps were common, so recent titles such as <em>Portal 2</em> are unplayable. Only older games can be played with anything resembling smoothness, and that\'s with the graphics settings on minimum.</p><p>With its thin and light body, we were hoping the HP ProBook 5330m\'s battery life would further boost portability. Unfortunately, the laptop died after just 139 minutes of watching video. </p><p>This is below average for an Intel Core machine, and we\'d usually expect closer to three hours of life from a single charge. Only the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo ThinkPad X1</a> gave more disappointing battery life recently.</p><p>If you cut back to basic usage – for instance, working on your accounts or bashing out emails – then you should manage just over three hours. However, considering our average daily commute is perilously close to that, we still found ourselves lugging the charger wherever we went.</p><p><strong>Benchmarks</strong><br />3DMark 2006 – 3690<br />Cinebench - 10646<br />Battery Eater \'05 – 139 mins</p><p><img alt=\"HP probook 5330m\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/HP%20ProBook%205330m/HP%20ProBook%205330m%20Front-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Snapping at the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks/lenovo-thinkpad-x1-972098/review\">Lenovo ThinkPad X1</a>\'s heels is HP\'s latest ultra-portable business PC laptop, the ProBook 5330m. </p><p>The 1.9kg aluminium frame is just 28mm thick and surprisingly tough, but can it deliver the kind of top performance we\'d expect from a modern business machine?</p><p><strong>We liked</strong></p><p>The light and compact body means the HP ProBook 5330m is no chore to carry around. Despite the slender build, Intel\'s Sandy Bridge Core i5 processor provides excellent performance, able to multi-task with ease. You won\'t need to replace this laptop any time soon.</p><p>Security is also a highlight. You can log in using your fingerprints or even your face, and easily encrypt your data using HP\'s pre-installed software.</p><p>But it isn\'t all about work. Movies look great on the bright, sharp and colourful 13.3-inch screen, despite the lack of a glossy Super-TFT coating. Even the built-in Beats speakers are decent, although a little weak on top volume. You can carry around a decent-sized media collection thanks to the 500GB hard drive.</p><p><img alt=\"HP probook 5330m\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Computing/HP%20ProBook%205330m/HP%20ProBook%205330m%20Front%20Angle-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>We disliked</strong></p><p>While the Intel processor on the HP ProBook 5330m is impressively powerful, it also has to handle graphics, because there\'s no dedicated GPU. If you want to play the latest games or edit some video, this isn\'t the machine for you.</p><p>We were also disappointed to see the battery deplete after little more than two hours of regular use. Cut back to basic operations and you\'ll squeeze a little more life from it, but this is a big shame considering the ultra-portable build.</p><p>The design also split opinions, and we would have preferred a more curved, friendly appearance. The word \'desirable\' can\'t be thrown at the boxy shell, no matter how durable or slim it is. We also found the occasional key press didn\'t register, despite the otherwise excellent build quality.</p><p><strong>Verdict</strong></p><p>Performance and build quality are what we\'d expect, and if you need a secure and portable business machine then the HP ProBook 5330m is a good option. </p><p>Unfortunately, the niggly usability is irritating and the poor battery life means you\'ll be lugging the charger around.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradars-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar\'s reviews guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks\">Read more laptop reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ef9478/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16c9c9ae/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Claptops0Eportable0Epcs0Claptops0Eand0Enetbooks0Cacer0Easpire0Eone0E7210E980A2460Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Acer Aspire One 721</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ca2fa5/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Claptops0Eportable0Epcs0Claptops0Eand0Enetbooks0Casus0Ex32a0E980A2480Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Asus X32A</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e830c6/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Claptops0Eportable0Epcs0Claptops0Eand0Enetbooks0Capple0Emacbook0Epro0E170Einch0E20E2ghz0E9829920Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Apple MacBook Pro 17-inch 2.2GHz</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ef9477/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Claptops0Eportable0Epcs0Claptops0Eand0Enetbooks0Csony0Evaio0Evpc0Ez21v9e0E9833670Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Sony VAIO Z Series</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+HP+ProBook+5330m&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Flaptops-portable-pcs%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fhp-probook-5330m-983545%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+HP+ProBook+5330m&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Flaptops-portable-pcs%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fhp-probook-5330m-983545%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877795864/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ef9478/kg/216-221-239-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877795864/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ef9478/kg/216-221-239-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/sStus3Z5LKI\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/sStus3Z5LKI/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',14385,NULL,'2011-07-26 16:18:00'),(176,'Review: LG 42LV550T','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LV550T/edited%20images/LV5500%20FRONT-2-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Although LG\'s passive 3D system has comprehensively proven its worth, at least where relatively compact screen sizes are concerned, it still comes as a slight relief to find that the brand\'s 42LV550T doesn\'t have 3D built in. It means there\'s no need to have to get into the whole passive vs active 3D philosophical debate again, allowing this review to focus solely on the product itself rather than larger issues beyond it. </p><p>What\'s more, despite its lack of 3D, the 42-inch smart TV has a decent quantity of tricks to get stuck into. The LV550T series does, after all, represent the top end of LG\'s non-3D TVs, and the brand traditionally isn\'t shy of delivering plenty of bang for your buck with its relatively high-end sets.</p><p>Among the LG 42LV550T\'s headline features is something called MCI 500Hz. The MCI bit stands for Motion Clarity Index, confirming that this is a feature designed to boost the appearance of motion. </p><p>There will be a little more detail on this later, but for now it seems safe to say that this new \'measurement\' appears to be a direct response to Samsung\'s use of similarly high CMR (Clear Motion Rate) figures on the spec lists of its TVs. </p><p>The LG 42LV550T also enjoys edge LED lighting, LG\'s full 2011 Smart TV service, a Freeview HD tuner and extensive multimedia playback via both a USB port and LG\'s PLEX multimedia conduit for files stored on a PC or Mac.</p><p>Other models in the same range are the 47-inch 47LV550T, 37-inch 37LV550T and 32-inch <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs/lg-32lv550t-962451/review\">32LV550T</a>. </p><p>If the LV550T range\'s features all sound good to you but you want 3D as well, the equivalent 3D model is the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs/lg-42lw550t-954985/review\">42LW550T</a>. </p><p>The LG 42LV550T\'s price feels about right to us – maybe a touch better than right – for what\'s on offer. Especially if you\'re attracted by its now rather excellent PLEX multimedia support.</p><p>However, if you want something a little cheaper, the next range down is the LV450U. This series only has a standard definition tuner, lacks smart TV functionality and uses MCI 400 rather than MCI 500.</p><p><img alt=\"LG 42lv550t\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LV550T/edited%20images/LV5500%2045%20L-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>In keeping with most 2011 TVs, the LG 42LV550T uses an edge LED lighting system. This immediately delivers an obvious design boost, since the set\'s very trim around the back compared with most conventional LCD TVs. It should also deliver energy benefits – LG claims its edge LED TVs use as much as 40% less energy than normal CCFL lighting systems.</p><p>The LG 42LV550T\'s design looks pretty nice from the front, too, with a reasonably narrow bezel that\'s given extra swagger by a glossy finish and the way it tapers to a point at its extremities.</p><p>TVs as slim and light (13.2kg) as the LG 42LV550T obviously lend themselves nicely to wall hanging, so it\'s nice to find that all of its connections have been arranged so that you can access them from the side or bottom of the TV; they don\'t just point straight out.</p><p>The connections in question are extensive. Four HDMIs lead the charge, joined among other things by a pair of USB ports, a D-Sub PC port, a LAN port, a component video input and an RS-232 control port that people building integrated home networks will appreciate.</p><p>The USBs can be used for either making the TV Wi-Fi ready via an optional dongle, or else playing back a healthy variety of music, photo and video file formats – including Xvid, DivX and MKV. </p><p>As for the LAN, this serves no less than three potential functions. First, it\'s there as mandatory but currently pointless support for the set\'s built-in Freeview HD tuner. Second, it provides access to LG\'s new Smart TV online content service, which will be covered in detail in a moment. Finally, it allows you to stream files stored on connected PCs or Macs via the rather pleasantly presented and flexible PLEX interface. </p><p><img alt=\"LG 42lv550t\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LV550T/LG%2042LV550T%20angled-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>LG is currently the only brand using PLEX, and in earlier reviews it caused quite a few problems, particularly when trying to get the TV talking to Apple Macs. </p><p>Rather brilliantly, though, these previous Mac communication problems were fixed on the LG 42LV550T, which hooked up with a PLEX-enabled Mac as soon as it was added to the network. It then proceeded to work very stably, even when streaming HD camcorder files. </p><p>LG\'s Smart TV service, meanwhile, impresses once more with the quality of its presentation and the leap in its content level versus last year\'s models. Headline services comprise an open web browser, BBC iPlayer, Acetrax movies, VTuner internet radio, YouTube, Picasa and the inevitable Facebook and Twitter apps. </p><p>Other so-called \'Premium\' apps include Woomi for TV, Funspot for games, mlb.tv for watching baseball, Dailymotion, Google Maps, Viewster, iConcerts, Al Jazeera, CineTrailer, AUPEO! Personal radio and AccuWeather.</p><p>There\'s also a vast quantity of second-tier apps – around 115 at our latest count – covering games, lifestyle, education, news/information and entertainment. The vast majority of these secondary, download-them-if-you-want-them apps are of niche interest, to say the least. So much so that it\'s hard to imagine anyone filling the set\'s 300MB of provided app memory particularly fast. </p><p>One other little negative point to raise here, too, is that during the review process, some of the Premium services took quite a long time to load. </p><p>The 42LV550T joins the majority of LG TVs in receiving the endorsement of the Imaging Science Foundation (ISF). This indicates that the TV has enough picture set-up options to be professionally calibrated. </p><p>If you want to have a go at in-depth calibration for yourself, the sort of fine-tuning options available include adjustments for the contrast and brightness of the RGB colour elements; the colour and tone settings for the RGBCMY colour elements; backlight control; gamma presets and 2pt or 10pt white balance adjustment.</p><p>The \'Advanced\' picture sub-menu also contains all sorts of processing options, such as MPEG and standard noise reduction tools, a dynamic contrast system, a black level booster and a \'Super Resolution\' feature for increasing the picture\'s sharpness. </p><p>To be honest, though, most of these options, aside perhaps from the Dynamic Contrast one, are best left turned off, especially if you\'re watching an HD source, because they can cause the picture to look processed.</p><p>The last picture adjustments of note are an optional Local Dimming system that can control portions of the edge LED lights separately to enhance contrast performance, and various settings for the set\'s TruMotion processing. There\'s even a manual TruMotion mode where you can adjust how hard the processing works on judder and blur separately.</p><p>The last thing to quickly mention on the LG 42LV550T\'s features is the MCI 500Hz figure noted earlier. The 500Hz bit doesn\'t refer to an actual image refresh rate of 500Hz in the traditional sense. In fact, the native refresh rate is 100Hz, with the other 400Hz being delivered by a combination of a scanning backlight and the set\'s motion processing.</p><p><img alt=\"LG 42lv550t\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LV550T/edited%20images/LV5500%20FRONT-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The LG 42LV550T\'s pictures are a classic game of two halves, in that it looks great with bright scenes, but slightly off with dark ones.</p><p>The problem with dark scenes is that while LG has provided a healthy number of tools aimed at getting a convincing black level response during dark scenes, there doesn\'t seem to be a combination of settings that delivers a totally satisfying final result.</p><p>Starting with the Local Dimming feature turned on, for instance, it quickly became apparent that even on the feature\'s least aggressive setting it causes obvious blocks of light to appear around bright objects when they\'re appearing against dark backgrounds. So naturally that feature was turned off right away.</p><p>However, turning this feature off caused quite a drop off in the depth of black that the LG 42LV550T\'s screen can resolve. Making sure the Dynamic contrast system was turned on to its lowest setting improved things a bit, although turning this any higher made the image look unstable, with frequent brightness jumps.</p><p>Setting the separate Black Level option to low is worth a try, too, but be warned that even on its least powerful setting this can cause shadow detail to be reduced during dark scenes.</p><p>Further complications find the provided Cinema preset failing to look at all convincing during dark scenes, with far too much low brightness detailing getting crushed out of the picture, and the appearance of subtle but undeniable backlight \'clouds\' over parts of the picture if you\'re watching in a dark room. </p><p>However, the impact of the clouding is reduced almost to nothing if you\'re watching in a bright room, or if you\'re watching bright scenes.</p><p><img alt=\"LG 42lv550t\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LV550T/LG%2042LV550T%20front-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>In fact, with bright footage the LG 42LV550T is a highly accomplished performer. </p><p>Two things in particular stand out right away: sharpness and brightness. Regarding the former, HD material looks impressively detailed and crisp, especially as the set doesn\'t suffer badly at all with motion blur, even if you decide against using the TruMotion system. </p><p>As for the brightness, pictures look intensely dynamic, punchy and colour-rich, except during very dark scenes. In fact, the set\'s portrayal of bright parts of the picture is so enjoyably aggressive, it effectively hides the screen\'s black level shortcomings during shots where there\'s a bold mix of light and darks, leaving only predominantly dark scenes to reveal the black level issues noted earlier.</p><p>Colours are decently – perhaps totally – consistently natural in tone too, although the presets on offer all benefit from a little fine-tuning via the colour management features. </p><p>Also pleasing for an inexpensive TV is how well defined the colour blends are. There\'s no sign of the striping or patching noted with some of LG\'s really entry-level TVs, which helps pictures look more three-dimensional – without actually being 3D, of course!</p><p>With the set\'s motion processing, for most of the time you\'re probably best leaving it off, because the picture only suffers with a little motion blurring without it, and it can cause processing side effects, even in its lowest preset mode. </p><p>The only thing you might want to try – because this minimises unwanted side effects – is using a manual configuration, with the blur element turned way down and the judder element set to two or maybe three. Set the judder any higher and you\'ll find that film sources start to look unnaturally fluid.</p><p>The LG 42LV550T is a middling-to-good performer with standard-definition sources. Noise is reasonably suppressed during the upscaling process, but upscaled pictures don\'t ultimately look as sharp as they can on some rival sets.</p><p>A number of LG TVs this year have suffered quite excessively with input lag, making them unsuitable as gaming monitors. But the 42LV550T doesn\'t fare too badly, averaging 30ms over the course of 20 separate tests. </p><p>The lag actually shifted between a common level of 40ms and an occasional 6ms, but even the occasional 40ms maximum figure should only have a very minor impact on your gaming performance.</p><p><img alt=\"LG 42lv550t\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LV550T/edited%20images/LV5500%2045%20L-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Sound quality</strong></p><p>Considering how slim its bezel is, the LG 42LV550T isn\'t actually a bad audio performer. It\'s certainly capable of going surprisingly loud without distortions setting in, and has an uncanny knack for picking up subtle treble details in a mix. Its mid-range is also just about open enough to handle dialogue convincingly at loud volumes. </p><p>Its weakness, predictably, is bass, which isn\'t powerful or deep enough to provide a convincing balance to the effective trebles, leaving the soundstage sounding rather unbalanced, and occasionally harsh, during action scenes.</p><p><strong>Value</strong></p><p>The 42LV550T\'s price feels about right - maybe a touch better than right - for what\'s on offer. Especially if you\'re attracted by its now rather excellent PLEX multimedia support.</p><p><strong>Ease of use</strong></p><p>For the most part, the LG 42LV550T\'s operating system is excellent. Leading the way is LG\'s mostly superb Smart Hub menu screen, which joins a similarly presented system on Samsung\'s TVs in offering direct access to a huge amount of sources and apps without looking overcrowded – despite also keeping a reduced version of the TV picture playing on the left-hand side.</p><p>The set\'s remote control is very likable, too. Its slim shape feels good in your hand, and its button layout is unusually coherent.</p><p>Picture calibration novices will appreciate the LG 42LV550T\'s Picture Wizard system, which guides you through a basic but effective picture calibration process.</p><p>Our only operational gripes are a) that the sheer volume of apps now available on LG\'s Smart TV platform makes navigating them rather daunting, and b) that the decision to place the access to the main set-up menus on the Smart Hub screen unnecessarily over-complicates things. It would have been much easier to provide direct access to the set-up menus via a dedicated remote button.</p><p><img alt=\"LG 42lv550t\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LV550T/edited%20images/LV5500%20FRONT-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>With no passive – or, for that matter, active – 3D to its name, LG\'s 42LV550T needs to rely on other charms to attract you to its cause. </p><p>These charms include an attractively slender and \'angular\' design, a full version of LG\'s latest Smart TV online service complete with a web browser, good compatibility with Macs and PCs and something dubbed MCI 500Hz – a fancy name for a pseudo 500Hz effect thanks to a combination of motion processing, a scanning backlight and 100Hz processing. </p><p>Inevitably, it uses edge LED lighting, while its extremely well-presented on-screen menus provide a wealth of picture set-up features and options, including a colour management system and all manner of tools for tweaking the set\'s black level response.</p><p>It\'s a pity that none of these tools enable the TV to produce a totally satisfying black level response, at least if you\'re watching in a dark room. But in most other ways – provided you\'re careful with some of its processing options – the LG 42LV550T\'s pictures can be considered a success, with excellent sharpness and colour response and decent motion handling. </p><p><strong>We liked</strong></p><p><strong><img alt=\"LG 42lv550t\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Home%20Entertainment/LG%2042LV550T/LG%2042LV550T%20front-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><br /></strong></p><p>During bright footage the LG 42LV550T\'s pictures can look excellent, thanks to some exceptionally vivid colours, high brightness levels and extreme sharpness – especially when you\'re watching HD sources. </p><p>The set\'s Smart TV online service has some excellent features, too, and the PLEX system for networking with your PC or Mac now works a treat. The set\'s on-screen menus and remote are also excellent.</p><p><strong>We disliked</strong></p><p>Really dark scenes can suffer numerous problems, depending on what settings you\'re using, and there doesn\'t seem to be any mix of settings that gets rid of every flaw. Also, too many of the apps in the app store are pointless. </p><p><strong>Final verdict</strong></p><p>If you\'re looking for a versatile, multimedia-savvy 42-inch TV that looks great and doesn\'t cost the earth, the LG 42LV550T has a lot going for it. </p><p>Its PLEX system works great with PCs and Macs alike, it plays back an unusually wide variety of multimedia file types and for most of the time it also produces extremely enjoyable pictures. </p><p>If you\'re a fan of watching films with the lights off, though, you might find yourself troubled by a few black level shortcomings.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradars-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar\'s reviews guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/televisions/plasma-and-lcd-tvs\">Read more TV reviews</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/hdtv/best-tv-2011-how-to-choose-the-best-tv-to-buy-709255\">Best TV 2011</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/television/hdtv/freeview-hd-the-complete-guide-630793\">Freeview HD: your questions answered</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ef5288/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+LG+42LV550T&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Faudio-visual%2Ftelevisions%2Fplasma-and-lcd-tvs%2Flg-42lv550t-983655%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+LG+42LV550T&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Faudio-visual%2Ftelevisions%2Fplasma-and-lcd-tvs%2Flg-42lv550t-983655%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877790627/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ef5288/kg/201-216-221-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877790627/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ef5288/kg/201-216-221-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/3kA-V1KvipU\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/3kA-V1KvipU/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',19015,NULL,'2011-07-26 15:40:00'),(177,'Review: Nissin Di622','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di622%20images/IMG_9649-200-200.jpg\" /><p>The Di622 is Nissin\'s mid-range flash, and with a Guide Number (GN) of 44 (ISO 100 at 105mm) it is in direct competition with the Canon Speedlite 430 EX II and Nikon Speedlight SB600. </p><p>But, as you might expect with it being a third party flash, it comes with a price tag that\'s around £100 lower.</p><p>The Di622 is compatible with Canon\'s E-TTL, E-TTL II or Nikon\'s I-TTL system depending upon the flashgun\'s fit. </p><h4>Build and Handling</h4><p>The Di622\'s build quality reflects its price, and whilst good, it doesn\'t quite match the finish of its rivals.</p><p>While the Canon Speedlite 430 EX II and Nikon Speedlight SB 600 both feature LCD screens that show the settings and modes, the Di622 has a simple set of coloured LED\'s and a few simple buttons.</p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di622\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di622%20images/IMG_9652-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>There\'s also an on/ off switch and power ratio is adjusted through a simple + - rocker switch. </p><p>On the side of the Di622 there\'s a standard PC sync connector for using the flash off camera. There\'s also a USB connector for hooking up to a computer and updating the firmware or adding new features, if and when they become available from Nissin. </p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di 622 side\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di622%20images/IMG_9663-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Although the Di622\'s design is simple, there are five modes accessed by pushing a small illuminated button. This button changes its colour of illumination depending on the mode selected, these modes include; TTL, Manual, Slave Digital, Slave Film and Wireless. Each colour highlights the mode that\'s selected. Coloured lettering on the back of the gun make it easy to identify what mode you are in until you get familiar with the Di622, but they aren\'t much help in the dark. </p><p><img alt=\"Di622 rear detail\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di622%20images/IMG_9661-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Using the camera with bounce flash the head has a vertical adjustment of 90 degrees, left rotation of 90 degrees and right of 180 degrees, this gives good flexibility to adjust the direction of the light exactly where needed.</p><h4>Performance</h4><p>In Slave Digital (SD) mode the Di622 ignores any pre-flash and only fires when the master flash unit fires. It is easy to set up and use works without issue. </p><p>Meanwhile, in Slave Film (SF) mode the flash syncs with more tradition single flash systems where there is no pre-flash from the master flashgun. Again selection and use is simple enough. </p><p>Wireless mode allows the Di622 to be used to trigger other flash units wirelessly, but there is only one channel available. This should be fine in most situations, but it would be limiting if shooting with other photographers with a similar flash setup.</p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di622 disffuser\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di622%20images/IMG_9658-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>In TTL mode, the Di622\'s power is set by the camera, but there is room for adjustment through the flash from –1.5EV to +1.5EV in 0.5EV steps. This power level can be adjusted using the Nissin \"My TTL\" settings and can be changed to +/- 0.75 EV in 0.25 increments, once you\'ve set your custom setting these are then remembered by the flash as default.</p><p>The Di622 is very easy to use, but the illumination isn\'t as even as its competition. The centre of the frame tends to be a bit brighter than the corners - though this can look nice in some situations.</p><h4>Verdict</h4><p>The Nissin Di622 offers features that are comparable with those in the Canon Speedlite 430 EX II and Nikon Speedlight SB600, but the build quality and finish are a step down.</p><p>The flash zoom motor is noisy, but results and ease of use do make this a good cheap alternative, provided you can accept the sometimes rather uneven illumination.</p><p><img alt=\"Nissing di622\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di622%20images/IMG_9656-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16eeefcc/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16edc438/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Cflashes0Cnissin0Edi8660E9833970Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Nissin Di866</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Nissin+Di622&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fflashes%2Fnissin-di622-983399%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Nissin+Di622&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fflashes%2Fnissin-di622-983399%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877980547/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16eeefcc/kg/201-232-238-245-253-262-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877980547/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16eeefcc/kg/201-232-238-245-253-262-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/iiNTbcCadMo\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/iiNTbcCadMo/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',6054,NULL,'2011-07-26 14:26:00'),(178,'Review: Nissin Di866','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di866%20images/IMG_9633-200-200.jpg\" /><p>The Nissin Di866 was launched as direct competition to the Canon 580 EX II and Nikon SB 900, albeit for a price of £190, over £100 less than its competitors. </p><p>A quick check through the specifications makes the Di866 seem very tempting, with impressive features including a GN of 60 (ISO 100 at 105mm), 2 greater than either the Canon 580 EX II or Nikon SB 900, and compatibility with Canon\'s ETTL II or Nikon\'s iTTL systems, depending on fit. </p><p>It also includes a Metz style secondary sub flash and a host of other great features.</p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di866\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di866%20images/IMG_9637-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Build and Handling</h4><p>A side-by-side comparison instantly shows the differences between the Di866 and Canon Speedlite 580 EX II with a lack of buttons to change modes and settings across the back. Instead Nissin has chosen an LCD interface to navigate through mode selections and adjustments. </p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di866 rear\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di866%20images/IMG_9630-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Whie the build quality is good, the Nissin flash doesn\'t have the robust feel and quality finish of the 580 EX II or SB 900, but does feel suitably robust to live up to professional use.</p><p>In use, selecting modes is straight forward using the multi function button. Although clicking around the screens to select modes or make adjustments is easy, there is a short but noticeable lag between each click. </p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di866 back\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di866%20images/IMG_9641-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>A nice feature of this interface is that the orientation of the display flips depending on the whether the flash is vertical or horizontal, with the four way control, multi function button (around the set button) mirroring the change. </p><p>There is also a sub flash mounted on the front of the unit which supplies a handy fill-in flash when bouncing the light, helpful when taking portraits. If you have no need of the extra light then it can be switch off through the advanced menu. </p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di866 subflash\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di866%20images/IMG_9645-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The head can be tilted up through 90 degrees, to the left by 90 degrees and to the right by 180 degrees, giving a good amount of flexibility when it comes to directing the light.</p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di866 twist\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di866%20images/IMG_9638-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Performance</h4><p>With four fully charged AA sized Eneloop batteries the flash takes about 6 seconds to recharge after each full power shot, which is just slower than it\'s rivals. </p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di866 batteries\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di866%20images/IMG_9644-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>At more standard power ratings the recharge time is dramatically reduced with flash ready almost instantly at 1/8 for portraits shots of up to 2.7mm (9 ft) distance. </p><p>In Auto mode the Di866 offers fully auto TTL (through the lens) metered lighting with no manual adjustment. There\'s more flexibility in TTL mode with –3 to +3EV adjustment in steps of 1/3 EV. These adjustments are made using the multi control pad. </p><p><img alt=\"Nissin di866 screen\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Accessories/Flashguns/Nissin%20Di866%20images/IMG_9640-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Further adjustment can be made by holding down the Set button for 2 seconds to access the advanced menu. From here you can switch on or off the sub flash, and manually set the head\'s zoom. </p><p>In TTL mode, as in Auto, the ISO and aperture setting information is gathered from the camera. </p><p>More advanced shooters may like to use the Manual and Aperture priority (Av) modes, which share the same menu icon. </p><p>In Manual mode the power can be set from 1/1 to 1/128, and again holding down the Set button will take you through to the advanced menu where the ISO and Aperture can be set.It is also possible to set the flashgun to work as a slve unit in Maanual mode.</p><p>In Slave Digital (SD) mode the Di866 ignores any pre-flash and only fires when the master flash unit fires. While in Slave Film (SF) mode the flash fires with the first flash and is designed for more traditional camera and flash systems without a pre-flash. </p><p>Aperture priority (Av) mode enables you to set the aperture, but as with Manual mode the sensitivity (ISO) needs to be set manually. </p><p>Multi mode is the option to go for if you need to fire the flash several times during a single exposure. It enables some creative effects, for example, generating a multiple exposure of a moving subject with a single shot. </p><p>The final mode available is Wireless, with two options Master or Remote. With Master selected, you can control a further three flashguns, whilst the Remote option sets the flash to act as a slave. </p><p>In both wireless modes the channel can be set to help avoid interference with other flashguns. There are a series of sockets on the side of the Di866 flashgun to enable PC sync (ie camera) and battery pack connection. </p><p>There\'s also a USB port to allow the flashgun to be connected to the computer so that the firmware can be updated.

The grey cartridge is used in both cases and, while it has the potential to add smoothness to areas of graduated colour, its main use is for black-and white printing. </p><p>This cartridge reduces the risk of unwanted colour casts in black-and-white prints because there\'s less reliance on coloured inks. </p><p>However, when switching to the greyscale printing option in our tests, to ensure that only black and grey inks were used, we experienced a drop in contrast and bite similar to that of the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/canon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781/review\">Pro9000</a>, which has no grey ink at all. At least regular printing speeds were maintained in greyscale mode – unlike on the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/canon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781/review\">Pro9000</a>, but in keeping with all the other printers in the group.</p><p><strong>Print Speed<br /></strong></p><p>Canon printers are usually very quick, but the Pro9500 proved the slowest in the group, at least in high-quality print mode. A3+ borderless prints took 8m 22s to produce, but at maximum quality settings, speed proved similar to the Epson A3+ printers on test, at 11m 15s. </p><p>That\'s still less than half as fast as the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/canon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781/review\">Pro9000</a>. Colour accuracy and contrast are very convincing on matte photo media, with good results for landscapes and portraits. </p><p>Our tests using Canon\'s glossy papers, including Photo Paper Pro Platinum and Photo Paper Plus Glossy II, were comparatively disappointing. Colours took on a faded appearance and contrast was poor, giving a slightly insipid look to prints. It\'s nowhere near a match for Canon\'s Pro9000 Mark II for glossy output. </p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners\">Read more printer reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3915/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecb043/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Ephoto0Er2880A0E446410A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Photo R2880</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecb044/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Epro0E3880A0E96390A50Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Pro 3880</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3916/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Ccanon0Epixma0Epro90A0A0A0Emark0Eii0E6317810Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon Pixma Pro9000 Mark II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3917/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Ephoto0E140A0A0E6322230Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Photo 1400</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Canon+Pixma+Pro9500+Mark+II&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fperipherals%2Fprinters-and-scanners%2Fprinters%2Fcanon-pixma-pro9500-mark-ii-963920%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Canon+Pixma+Pro9500+Mark+II&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fperipherals%2Fprinters-and-scanners%2Fprinters%2Fcanon-pixma-pro9500-mark-ii-963920%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877758757/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ed3915/kg/201-221-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877758757/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ed3915/kg/201-221-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/w_nG974zYiw\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/w_nG974zYiw/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',5329,NULL,'2011-07-26 10:42:00'),(180,'Review: Canon Pixma Pro9000 Mark II','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Digital%20Camera/DCM%20113/1.%20DCM113.kit_group.canon_pro9000-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Aiming to deliver the ultimate in colour quality on glossy paper, the dye-based Pro9000 has seven individual colour inks as well as photo black for a wide gamut. For a dye-based printer, it also produces very pleasing output on matte photo papers and fine-art stock. </p><p>The rear-mounted paper input tray accommodates photo paper up to A3+ size, while a front-loading feeder accepts individual sheets of up to 14x17 inches. However, borderless printing isn\'t supported on 14-inch media. Installing the printer is quick and easy, and the supporting driver and additional software is intuitive. </p><p><strong>Fast Results<br /></strong></p><p>The Pro9000 Mark II printed at twice the speed of any other printer in the group, delivering a high-quality borderless A3+ colour print in just 1m 54s. However, there\'s a catch in black-and-white photo printing. Without any grey cartridges, the only way to ensure that you avoid unwanted colour casts is to switch to greyscale printing. </p><p>This not only makes black-and-white photos look a little dull, with a lack of detail in darker tones, it also slows down the printer to a snail\'s pace. In maximum quality colour mode, the Pro9000 Mark II output an A4 borderless print in 2m 9s, but in greyscale mode it slowed to 15m 9s. </p><p>Back in colour mode, with auto colour/intensity enabled, the Pro9000 excels in producing vibrant landscape images, as well as giving a glamorous golden touch to skin tones. Manual colour adjustments are also available for landscape and portrait images, the latter giving slightly pinker skin tones. </p><p>The printer also delivered accurate results when Photoshop was given control of colour management. Overall, it\'s fast and glorious for colour, but black-and white printing is a disappointment. </p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners\">Read more printer reviews</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3916/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecb043/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Ephoto0Er2880A0E446410A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Photo R2880</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecb044/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Epro0E3880A0E96390A50Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Pro 3880</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3915/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Ccanon0Epixma0Epro950A0A0Emark0Eii0E963920A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon Pixma Pro9500 Mark II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3917/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Ephoto0E140A0A0E6322230Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Photo 1400</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Canon+Pixma+Pro9000+Mark+II&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fperipherals%2Fprinters-and-scanners%2Fprinters%2Fcanon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Canon+Pixma+Pro9000+Mark+II&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fperipherals%2Fprinters-and-scanners%2Fprinters%2Fcanon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877758756/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ed3916/kg/221-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877758756/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ed3916/kg/221-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/ACC8-eSplmc\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/ACC8-eSplmc/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',4741,NULL,'2011-07-26 10:40:00'),(181,'Review: Epson Stylus Photo 1400','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Digital%20Camera/DCM%20113/3.%20DCM113.kit_group.epson_photo1400-200-200.jpg\" /><p>The Stylus Photo 1400 uses the same Owl cartridges that act as high-yield options for some of Epson\'s A4 photo printers. However, with a relatively low capacity of 11.1ml per cartridge, they need replacing more often than most when ?tted in an A3+ printer. </p><p>The variety of colours is limited, with a traditional range of CMYK inks boosted by additional light cyan and light magenta. This means that you\'re lacking the extra red and green cartridges found in the Canon A3+ printers for an extended gamut.</p><p>Onboard printer controls are limited, too, although the printer driver has a good range of features, including customisable controls for ?ne-tuning print brightness, contrast, saturation and colour balance.</p><p>Like the other dye-based printer tested, the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/canon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781/review\">Canon Pro9000 Mark II</a>, the 1400 makes vibrant colour prints on glossy paper. In fact, prints can be a little too high in contrast with the Photo Enhance feature enabled or when using the printer\'s vivid colour mode, whereas some images in the standard colour mode can look a little muted. </p><p>Overall, it can be tricky to achieve the right balance and, to make matters worse, our review sample produced particularly dull results when handing over the control of colour management to Photoshop.</p><p><strong>TEST PRINTS</strong></p><p> In maximum quality mode, the Epson 1400 is slow for a dye-based printer, taking 11m 16s to produce a borderless A3+ print, compared with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/canon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781/review\">Pro9000</a>\'s 4m 25s. That\'s akin to the print speeds of pigment-based printers, but unlike the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/canon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781/review\">Pro9000</a>, it doesn\'t slow down in greyscale-printing mode.

Epson\'s R2880 o?ers eight-ink printing, including two black and two grey inks, designed to produce immaculate black-and-white photo prints. The not-so-good part is that the complete range of cartridges adds up to nine, but there\'s only space for eight of them in the printer. </p><p>This means that you have to physically swap the photo black and matte black cartridges every time you want to switch between printing on glossy or matte media. </p><p>The process takes about ?ve minutes to complete, once all the print heads have been refreshed and the black channel has been purged of any remaining photo or matte black ink. It\'s time-consuming, inconvenient and a waste of ink. Indeed, switching from matte to glossy media just four times can be enough to drain the photo black cartridge, without even doing any printing.</p><p><strong>Print Quality</strong></p><p>The R2880 redeems itself when it comes to print quality, with vivid colour and fabulous black-and-white output even on glossy paper, which is always a challenge for pigment-based printers. In the Advanced B&amp;W Photo print mode, only black (photo or matte), light black and light light black inks are used, so unwanted colour casts aren\'t an issue. If you do fancy a warm or cool tint, this is available in the Advanced B&amp;W Photo mode, at which point the R2880 calls on the required colour cartridges.</p><p>Our only criticism of print quality is that skin tones were a bit cool and un?attering in our tests, although they warmed up a little when switching to the Photo Enhance (people printing mode). Print speeds are average for a pigment-based printer, as you\'ll see from our comparison table, and a neat extra is the roll feeder for panoramic printing.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners\">Read more printer reviews</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecb043/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecb044/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Epro0E3880A0E96390A50Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Pro 3880</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3915/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Ccanon0Epixma0Epro950A0A0Emark0Eii0E963920A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon Pixma Pro9500 Mark II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3916/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Ccanon0Epixma0Epro90A0A0A0Emark0Eii0E6317810Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon Pixma Pro9000 Mark II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3917/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Ephoto0E140A0A0E6322230Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Photo 1400</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Epson+Stylus+Photo+R2880&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fperipherals%2Fprinters-and-scanners%2Fprinters%2Fepson-stylus-photo-r2880-446410%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Epson+Stylus+Photo+R2880&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fperipherals%2Fprinters-and-scanners%2Fprinters%2Fepson-stylus-photo-r2880-446410%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877832153/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ecb043/kg/201-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877832153/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ecb043/kg/201-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/PVJo5y7MOKY\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/PVJo5y7MOKY/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',4695,NULL,'2011-07-26 09:51:00'),(183,'Review: Epson Stylus Pro 3880','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Digital%20Camera/DCM%20113/6.%20DCM113.kit_group.epson_pro3880-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Upsizing your prints from A4 to A3 makes them twice as big – go up to A2 and they\'re twice as big again, four times the size of an A4 picture. A2 printers are usually correspondingly large, too, and expensive, but the Epson Stylus Pro 3880\'s relatively modest dimensions and price make it an attractive proposition. </p><p>The A2 print size of 17x22 inches looks impressively larger than the 13x19 inches of an A3+ image, but the aspect ratio is a bit on the square side for photo prints. Considering that the 3880 can create prints of up to 17x37.4 inches, it seems strange that Epson doesn\'t sell A2+ or \'Super A2\' sized media in any of its photographic or ?ne-art media ranges.</p><p>One thing that de?nitely is super-sized, though, is the 3880\'s ink cartridges. These are a generous 80ml, which means you can keep printing for much longer without needing to change cartridges. Plus both photo black and matte black are installed simultaneously, like with the R3000. </p><p>Sadly though, you still waste about 1.5ml of matte black ink or 4.5ml of photo black ink when switching between matte and glossy media. The bigger cartridges provide a saving of about £1.50 per A3+ colour print, compared with the R2880. The ?ipside is that a complete set of cartridges for the 3880 will set you back a whopping £450.</p><p><strong>Big Picture</strong></p><p>Compared with the R2880 and R3000, resolution drops from 5,760x1,440dpi to 2,880x1,440dpi, but image quality is still excellent. </p><p>With a lower resolution, print speeds are noticeably faster in maximum quality mode, with an A3+ print taking 8m 53s to produce, compared with 11m 9s on the Epson R2880. A2 prints take 7m 9s and 12m 38s in high quality and maximum quality settings respectively. </p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners\">Read more printer reviews</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/epson-stylus-photo-r2880-446410/review\">Epson Stylus Photo R2880 review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/canon-pixma-pro9000-mark-ii-631781/review\">Canon PIXMA Pro9000 Mark II review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/peripherals/printers-and-scanners/printers/canon-pixma-pro9500-mark-ii-963920/review\">Canon PIXMA Pro9500 Mark II review</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecb044/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecb043/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Ephoto0Er2880A0E446410A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Photo R2880</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3915/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Ccanon0Epixma0Epro950A0A0Emark0Eii0E963920A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon Pixma Pro9500 Mark II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3916/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Ccanon0Epixma0Epro90A0A0A0Emark0Eii0E6317810Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon Pixma Pro9000 Mark II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ed3917/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Cperipherals0Cprinters0Eand0Escanners0Cprinters0Cepson0Estylus0Ephoto0E140A0A0E6322230Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Epson Stylus Photo 1400</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Epson+Stylus+Pro+3880&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fperipherals%2Fprinters-and-scanners%2Fprinters%2Fepson-stylus-pro-3880-963905%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Epson+Stylus+Pro+3880&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fperipherals%2Fprinters-and-scanners%2Fprinters%2Fepson-stylus-pro-3880-963905%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877832152/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ecb044/kg/253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877832152/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ecb044/kg/253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/Near5nRckP0\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/Near5nRckP0/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',5225,NULL,'2011-07-26 09:49:00'),(184,'Review: SV Sound PC-12 Plus','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Home%20Cinema%20Choice/HCC%20198/HCC198.svs.wood01-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Coming up with a natty little subwoofer that can look like a radiator just isn\'t SVS\' style. Neither is designing a tiny box with a bonkers amplifier to make it all but explode with power.</p><p> No, SVS has got attitude.

Controls include gain, low pass filter (slope and frequency in seven steps from 125Hz to 31Hz), phase by 15? steps, \'room gain comp\' (on/off), a feature called Subwoofer Tune and a single band parametric equaliser. </p><p><img alt=\"SVS pc-12 plus\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Home%20Cinema%20Choice/HCC%20198/HCC198.svs.back-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>This amounts to a couple of curves you can add on and a room cut if you need it. I turned the subwoofer down to deepest bass at 16Hz. I tuned it by ear, knowing that my room has a 70Hz peak and the bass was vast. </p><p>Tight, sexy, rich and unflappable on music, it tracked with melodious intent and was effortless in headroom. With <em>Paul</em> on Blu-Ray, the UFO crash had huge, absurd monster deflection and the sheer amount of air moved is way beyond impressive. </p><p>That moving, ported air has a \'stretchiness\', so it wasn\'t completely tight, but you can seal those ports one by one for fine-tuning. </p><p>Yes, some people will think this subwoofer is far too ugly, but users can always lie it on its side and hide it behind the sofa. Your neighbours will know you have it, though. Even if you live in a detached house.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/hi-fi-and-av-speakers\">Read more Hi-Fi and AV speaker reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecbd90/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e5d4f7/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Caudio0Evisual0Chi0Efi0Eand0Eaudio0Chi0Efi0Eand0Eav0Espeakers0Ctannoy0Earena0Ehighline0E30A0A0E9811320Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Tannoy Arena Highline 300</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ec6d41/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Caudio0Evisual0Chi0Efi0Eand0Eaudio0Chi0Efi0Eand0Eav0Espeakers0Cmagnat0Equantum0E650A0Eseries0E9815160Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Magnat Quantum 650 Series</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+SV+Sound+PC-12+Plus&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Faudio-visual%2Fhi-fi-and-audio%2Fhi-fi-and-av-speakers%2Fsvs-pc-12-plus-982830%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+SV+Sound+PC-12+Plus&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Faudio-visual%2Fhi-fi-and-audio%2Fhi-fi-and-av-speakers%2Fsvs-pc-12-plus-982830%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877750102/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ecbd90/kg/221-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877750102/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ecbd90/kg/221-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/BTW0BPP1XIA\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/BTW0BPP1XIA/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',4391,NULL,'2011-07-26 09:30:00'),(185,'Review: Panasonic SC-BTT775','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Home%20Cinema%20Choice/HCC%20198/HCC198.pansys.wood01-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Panasonic\'s SC-BTT775 is a multi-talented home cinema beast, offering 3D Blu-ray playback, HDMI switching, a smattering of Smart TV services and a complete 5.1 surround sound system with the option to add extra wireless surround back speakers. </p><p>Like the subwoofer, the cylindrical tallboy speakers feel solid enough, but attaching them to their stands is a bit of a faff. Nor is the end result that appealing - they have a tendency to wobble. </p><p>While the system is no catwalk queen, at least the menu has a contemporary look with icons that pulse when selected. </p><p>Colour-coded speaker plugs make set up simple. CGI movies often have the most inventive soundtracks and provide ideal workouts for surround sound systems, and the <em>Monsters Vs Aliens</em> 3D Blu-ray has several scenes that prove how adept the SC-BTT775 is in the audio department. </p><p>At the start of the scene where Susan is chased through downtown San Francisco, a piece of paper blows across the screen from front right to rear left, breaking the silence. It\'s a visual 3D trick, but its movement is enhanced by the journey of the fluttering sounds across the soundscape. </p><p>Then, as you hear the thumping strides of a giant robot, the room starts to vibrate as the sub/sat combo gradually wells up. But everything is nicely controlled, as Susan\'s breath can still be clearly heard through the centre channel. </p><p>Furthermore, the clunk of a lamp post hitting the ground is bombastic enough to startle you, and the cooing of pigeons can clearly be heard from the rears. However, as Susan approaches Golden Gate Bridge and the orchestration of the music starts to dominate, it becomes less clear where sounds are coming from and the system feels a little overwhelmed. I opted to turn it down. </p><p>Fantastic Four\'s DTS-HD Master soundtrack lacks the sonic craft of Monsters Vs Aliens, but still comes through with gusto. Dialogue such as Ben\'s self-pitying muttering on the Brooklyn Bridge is pin-sharp, but at higher volume the centre channel starts to sound a tad harsh. And as the crash scene unfolds, you realise how the system\'s beanpole speakers don\'t quite have the welly to cope with cacophonous sounds. </p><p>The sub fares better – with <em>Avatar</em>\'s DTS-HD Master soundtrack the opening shot of the space ship is given tremendous impact by the thunderous rumble of its engines. </p><p>One of the BTT775\'s many claimed talents is Cinema Surround Plus, which aims to deliver a 22-channel effect via a lot of virtual height and width tomfoolery. The results are noticeable, with certain material, but whether it really adds to the audio experience is debatable. AV purists will choose to avoid it. </p><p><strong>Tech Labs</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Tech labs\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Benchmark%20graphics/thinbanner-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Power consumption: Watts</strong><br />Idle: 32 Watts<br />Playing: 95 Watts</p><p><strong>Loading: Boot/Java</strong><br />Boot speed & tray eject: 11 seconds<br />Disc loading and Java: 50 seconds</p><p><strong>Classy visuals</strong></p><p> All of these discs are complemented by superb visuals. The BTT775\'s player matches standalone decks in serving up some first-class images, with outstanding clarity, colour fidelity and contrast. Even the built-in upscaler makes a decent fist of turning standard-def DVDs into highly watchable pseudo-HD ones, although what classics such as <em>The Long Good Friday</em> gain in resolution they lose in some softness. </p><p>In general, 3D playback is excellent but 2D to 3D conversion is only partially successful. Early on in <em>Avatar</em> when Sully emerges from his long sleep, the hangar stretches far into the distance and can look amazing on a good 3D deck. Here, when converted from 2D it does look convincing, but can\'t match the real deal for impact. Similarly, the floating insects in the Na\'vi jungle don\'t ping out like they should. </p><p>That said, it\'s a better 3D experience than Sky\'s 3D broadcast. When watching 3D you can play with the depth setting and impose a vignette of varying thickness and colour. This softens the edges and reduces eye strain, but can distract from the picture itself, particularly if you select red, blue or grey for the border. Moreover, it doesn\'t work with letterbox movies. </p><p>The BTT775\'s multimedia potential is a bit underwhelming. Unlike Panasonic\'s new TVs which feature the improved VieraConnect service, this all-in-one system carries the first-gen VieraCast service. This includes YouTube, Twitter, Skype and Acetrax, but sorely lacks iPlayer. And, despite DLNA capability, I was unable to get the BTT775 to talk with my Windows 7 laptop, nor would its iPod player recognise my iPod Touch, which is listed as being compatible. </p><p>Overall, the SC-BTT775 is a decent starter system for the fledgling home cinema fan. It does well visually and is no slouch sonically – but the build quality and vintage online portal disappoint.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/home-cinema-systems\">Read more home cinema system reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ec6d40/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Panasonic+SC-BTT775&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Faudio-visual%2Fhi-fi-and-audio%2Fhome-cinema-systems%2Fpanasonic-sc-btt775-982817%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Panasonic+SC-BTT775&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Faudio-visual%2Fhi-fi-and-audio%2Fhome-cinema-systems%2Fpanasonic-sc-btt775-982817%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108467841885/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ec6d40/kg/216-221-239-253-259-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108467841885/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ec6d40/kg/216-221-239-253-259-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/d-iST7D4fnU\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/d-iST7D4fnU/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',6825,NULL,'2011-07-26 09:00:00'),(186,'Review: Magnat Quantum 650 Series','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Home%20Cinema%20Choice/HCC%20198/HCC198.magnat.wood01-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Branding is funny stuff.

The Quantum 657 front towers are dual-ported to the back, with big open-mouthed curvy ports which Magnat calls Airflex. </p><p>One of the bigger drivers is coupled up to the tweeter as a mid-bass driver, while the other two drivers of the same size are used for bass. You get a bi-wire/biamp set of posts to the rear – and if you do divide up the speaker with two wires, removing the supplied jumpers, a passive crossover inside will sort out the \'hoch\' from the \'mitt\'. </p><p>The 653 bookshelves, used as rears, have just the equivalent of the upper section of the 657s – the midand high- driver – and the 63 centre uses a brace of midbasses in a smaller 5.25-inch size straddling the same tweeter used all round. </p><p>The latter is a sexy piece of kit for such a low-price set of speakers. It has Ferrofluid in its voice coil gap and uses a fabric dome. Soft fabric domes generally sound nicer than harder ones (unless they are costly examples, or made of Diamond – which is the same thing, I suppose), while the magnetic \'liquid-Iron\' stays solidly in the gap in the magnet, serving to rapidly conduct heat away from the coil. </p><p>It won\'t squeeze up and heat up like air does, compressing in the gap. All this technical cleverness adds up to a tweeter that can go louder for longer, be less stressed and better-sounding with low power compression. This is normal on more expensive speakers, but not what you necessarily expect to see at this level. </p><p>The 625A subwoofer stands on feet above its own plinth. This is good as it means the maker understands bass and hasn\'t just boxed up a driver with an off-the-shelf amp plate from a factory. Magnat has fired the driver down onto a solid wooden platform, so it has to squeeze out of the surrounding gap at the bottom. Done right, this is like compressing explosives for better results, and makes the two gas-flowed rear ports really breathe some lows out. </p><p><strong>Alien resurrection </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Quantum 650\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Home%20Cinema%20Choice/HCC%20198/HCC198.magnat.03-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>After finally downloading my Father\'s Day gift, sci-fi comedy <em>Paul</em>, to my iPod (I adore the Triple-Play disc concept, but wish Apple would speed up...), it was time to run the traditional Blu-ray platter through these floorstanders. </p><p>Setting the subwoofer is dead easy. You just get a 50Hz-150Hz sweepable crossover knob, a gain knob and a regular 0-180? phase flipper switch. This is always worth a go. If one way sounds better, then it\'s correct in that phase, in that spot, in your room. It\'s really that simple. </p><p>Connections are a high-level stereo speaker input set of binding posts and a single LFE phono input. The eponymous star of the film is an alien who crashed in Roswell in New Mexico in 1947 and has been trying to escape ever since. The movie opens in \'47, when we learn how the character got his name while experiencing the UFO crash. And sadly, we find the limit of this 5.1 system immediately. The subwoofer. </p><p>While the Magnat 625A Quantum has 275W of power, it\'s not enough for a crashing spaceship when the rest of this array is winging it in over your head. Despite there being some hint of a limiting circuit in the multi-language manual, the sub simply ran out of grunt and farted. I turned it down significantly and to be fair, as my son carried on watching the rest of the movie (which I actually went to the flicks to see, despite the cheap projectors) the house was gently rumbling along. </p><p>But for this system, I would want a brace of these woofers in my room. These speakers are deeply articulate and are very good at sensible levels. With a sweet textured detail to the upper mids and highs, the clever tweeters also get some acoustic benefit from living in little stubby horns. </p><p>Unfortunately, the sound can become a bit hard and brittle if you drive them over-enthusiastically, but again, for the sub-£2K price tag, you can\'t expect perfect detail and limitless power. </p><p>So, the Magnats\' scale and might departments are lacking compared to a big system that has a driver with a high surface area. But at all other times, you will get a really well-placed soundstage, with horribly difficult instruments to reproduce, such as closely mic-ed plucked guitars and pianos, all sounding delicious, sweet and accurate. </p><p>This deft touch is well shown off as the two geeks (Simon Pegg and Nick Frost) meet Paul for the first time. He looms out of the darkness slowly and we hear his voice, quietly spoken, before we see him. You can almost hear the space around them in the Nevada desert night. </p><p>Overall, these are a really serious proposition if fidelity matters most and they fit your budget. The array sounds great with music, too, and the sub\'s shortcomings are less apparent on films without explosions. Which, I\'ve been told, do exist…</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/hi-fi-and-audio/hi-fi-and-av-speakers\">Read more Hi-Fi and AV speaker reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ec6d41/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e5d4f7/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Caudio0Evisual0Chi0Efi0Eand0Eaudio0Chi0Efi0Eand0Eav0Espeakers0Ctannoy0Earena0Ehighline0E30A0A0E9811320Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Tannoy Arena Highline 300</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ecbd90/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Caudio0Evisual0Chi0Efi0Eand0Eaudio0Chi0Efi0Eand0Eav0Espeakers0Csvs0Epc0E120Eplus0E982830A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: SV Sound PC-12 Plus</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Magnat+Quantum+650+Series&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Faudio-visual%2Fhi-fi-and-audio%2Fhi-fi-and-av-speakers%2Fmagnat-quantum-650-series-981516%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Magnat+Quantum+650+Series&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Faudio-visual%2Fhi-fi-and-audio%2Fhi-fi-and-av-speakers%2Fmagnat-quantum-650-series-981516%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108467841884/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ec6d41/kg/221-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108467841884/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16ec6d41/kg/221-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/JXRT0OuQ2TA\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/JXRT0OuQ2TA/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',8537,NULL,'2011-07-26 08:30:00'),(187,'Review: Apple Mac OS X 10.7 Lion','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/mac/images/macbookair2011/macbookair2011-2-200-200.jpg\" /><p>This eighth release of OS X brings us around 250 new features, many of which are inspired by Apple\'s mobile-device operating system, iOS. </p><p>Unlike previous versions of Mac OS, it isn\'t delivered on a disc (though Lion flash drives are due in August, for £55). </p><p>Instead, it\'s purchased, downloaded and installed from the Mac App Store. The App Store was introduced with OS X 10.6.6, so if you\'re running Leopard or earlier on a Mac that\'s capable of running Lion, you must install Snow Leopard before upgrading to the latest version of the operating system. </p><p>But as Snow Leopard only cost £25 and Lion is a penny shy of £21, their combined price is less than half the usual going rate for a Mac OS.</p><p><img alt=\"MacOS x 10.7\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%201-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>NEW LOOK: </strong><em>Mission Control and Launchpad are two of Lion\'s key features</em></p><p>To run Lion, you must have an Intel Mac with a Core 2 Duo, Core-i series or Xeon processor. The new operating system won\'t run on PowerPC Macs, or very early Intel models with Core Duo chips. You also need 2GB of RAM, where its predecessor only demanded 1GB. </p><p>Thankfully, upgrading your computer\'s memory is a fairly painless task, and as long as you buy from a third-party vendor instead of Apple, it\'s relatively inexpensive too.</p><p>Lion drops support for Rosetta, the dynamic translator used to run applications written for PowerPC processors on Intel machines. This means a Mac running Lion can\'t run PowerPC applications, so before you install, check whether any of your must-have apps are PPC. </p><p><img alt=\"OS x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%201-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>INTEL ONLY: </strong><em>Lion is the eighth release of OS X, and the second that only runs on Intel Macs</em></p><p>Installing Lion is incredibly easy. You just open the Mac App Store, buy the software and download it. The installer is downloaded to your Applications folder and added to the Dock. It runs automatically, but the installer disappears after it has run, so if you want to keep hold of it to upgrade other Macs or create a boot disc, quit the installer and copy it to an external drive before running.</p><p>The downloaded installer is around 3.76GB, which is about the same as a hi-def movie from iTunes. After buying it once, you can install it on all your Macs, so the £21 you paid for the operating system is an even bigger bargain.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%202-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>INSTALL:</strong><em> After downloading the Lion installer appears in your Applications folder</em></p><p>Installing Lion usually takes between ten minutes to half an hour, depending on your Mac. The first thing it does after restarting using the new operating system is to index your Mac for Spotlight, which usually takes longer than the install. </p><p>This is done in the background and is hardly a problem. Some applications take longer to open the first time you run them in Lion too, most notably Mail, which has to reindex your emails to take advantage of the app\'s new features. Again, this is hardly problematic, but it\'s best not to switch to Lion if you\'ve something urgent to do straight afterwards. </p><p>Overall, installing Mac OS X 10.7 Lion is a speedy and straightforward task requiring very little user intervention. There\'s very little that can go wrong here, but make sure you clone your hard drive beforehand just in case.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%202-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>EASY PEASY:</strong> <em>Installing OS X 10.7 Lion is a relatively painless task</em></p><p>Like all new versions of OS X, Lion brings a host of minor cosmetic tweaks, some of which are proving more popular than others. The gumdrop buttons in the top-left corner of a window are now smaller and less intense. </p><p>The Finder window\'s side bar icons have lost their colour, and the font used to name them is larger. Your boot drive doesn\'t appear in the Devices section, but you can change this in the Finder preferences, under the Side Bar tab.</p><p>By default, new Finder windows open in a new Side Bar option, All My Files. This arranges your personal files in Cover Flow-like rows that can be scrolled and viewed, and ordered according to criteria such as date, kind, size and name. </p><p>Unfortunately, it only shows files you keep inside your Home folder. If the majority of your data is stored outside your boot drive, this feature is likely to be of limited use. We hope Apple makes it more comprehensive in time, especially considering how many Mac users have an SSD for a boot drive and an HDD for data. </p><p>The Sidebar search folders based on kind and when a document was last opened are gone, but you can recreate them if you wish.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%203-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>COULD DO BETTER:</strong> The All My Files feature isn\'t as useful as it could be</p><p>You can now expand and contract windows from any side or corner, not just the bottom-right. Constraining with the Alt key also resizes from the opposite edge, and Shift-Alt preserves the aspect ratio as it resizes from all four sides. Less welcome is the removal of the pill-shaped button in the top-right corner, which previously minimised the window. </p><p>One of Lion\'s most controversial changes is its scrolling behaviour. Previously, scrolling controlled the window\'s scroll bar pellet, so scrolling up moved the pellet upwards, and the window\'s contents downwards. This has been reversed in Lion; scrolling directly interacts with the window\'s contents, so scrolling up moves the page up, like in iOS. </p><p>While it\'s difficult to get used to at first (and can be changed using the Mouse or Trackpad system preferences), it\'s actually more logical. Find a friend or relative who\'s never used a Mac before and get them to scroll a window; chances are they\'ll instinctively go for the Lion method.</p><p>The first time you open a Java application, you find Lion doesn\'t provide a Java runtime by default. Go to <a href=\"http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421\">http://support.apple.com/kb/DL1421</a> to download and install it.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%203.2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>UP OR DOWN:</strong> <em>Vertical scrolling behaviour is reversed in Lion, but you can change it back if you wish</em></p><p>With Lion, Gestures are a much more integral part of the operating system. So much so that desktop users should consider buying a Magic Trackpad to get the most out of the new OS. </p><p>Activating new features like Mission Control and Launchpad using Gestures is much quicker and easier than clicking on their Dock icons, and new Taps, Pinches and Swipes give you a much greater degree of control over your working environment. What was previously a useful asset for notebook users is now such a fundamental part of the Mac experience that people who don\'t use a trackpad are missing out. </p><p>That\'s not to say you can\'t use Lion with a Magic Mouse, or even an ordinary, third-party mouse. But after a few weeks with a Magic Trackpad, going back to a mouse feels like stepping out of a sports car and into a family saloon.</p><p>Like the new scrolling behaviour, Gestures can take a little getting used to. You might trigger multi-fingered gestures accidentally through resting your fingers on the trackpad while trying to move the pointer, for example, or move through your Safari browsing history when you were trying to scroll. But they soon become instinctive, and a real asset to the way you interact with your Mac.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%204-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>CHANGE TOUCH:</strong><em> You can configure your gestures in the Trackpad system preferences, and watch short animations showing them in action</em></p><p>While applications with full-screen modes have been around for years, Lion brings the feature natively to OS X, standardising their behaviour. Apps written to take advantage of Lion\'s Full Screen feature have an icon in the top-right corner of the window. </p><p>With a single click they fill the entire screen, cutting out borders and distractions. This is especially useful when using small-screen notebooks. Even the menu bar at the top of the screen (which offers a button to exit full-screen mode) only appears when you drag your pointer to it. </p><p>You can have more than one application open in this way, using a three-fingered swipe to navigate between full-screen apps, your desktop and the Dashboard.</p><p>Naturally, Apple\'s native OS X apps are already full-screen compatible, and the API has been made available to developers, so third-party software should soon make use of this excellent feature.</p><p>Unfortunately, Lion\'s Full Screen feature is currently single-display only. If you have a two-monitor set-up and go full-screen on your main display, the second screen is covered with the grey linen wallpaper used in several places in Lion OS (for example, for the background in Mission Control).</p><p> You could argue this is all part of the no-distractions philosophy that underpins the Full Screen feature, but surely it should be optional? We hope it becomes so with the first Lion update.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%204-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>COMPLETE VIEW:</strong> <em>Full Screen does away with distractions, but is incompatible with multiple monitors</em></p><p>Mission Control unifies Snow Leopard\'s Exposé, Spaces and Dashboard functions into a single feature. And it\'s magnificent. Accessed through a function key, a Dock icon or (best of all) a simple three-fingered gesture, Mission Control gives a birds-eye view of everything that\'s running on your Mac. </p><p>Open windows are grouped according to application, so you can quickly and easily navigate to the one you\'re looking for. Across the top of the screen, your Dashboard, Full Screen applications and Spaces desktops are shown. In effect, the top section of the screen replicates Snow Leopard\'s Spaces function and the lower half becomes Exposé. </p><p>And integrating them on a single screen enhances both. If your desktop is getting cluttered, it\'s really easy to open Mission Control, add a second desktop and drag windows from your main work area to the secondary one. </p><p>Individual Exposé functions such as Application Windows and Show Desktop are still available, and can be accessed through the function keys as before, or through Gestures. You can configure the keys through the Mission Control preference pane, and the Gestures through the Trackpad pane, but the default settings are more than comfortable.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%205-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>BRINGING IT TOGETHER:</strong> <em>Mission Control is a useful and comprehensive fusion of Spaces and Exposé</em></p><p>Our only criticism of Mission Control is its aesthetics. It\'s far from attractive, and definitely not up to Apple\'s usual design standards. Perhaps the means for adding a second desktop could be clearer too; you hover over the right-hand side of the Spaces row until a plus sign appears. If you didn\'t know, you would never guess. Even so, Mission Control is an exciting addition to OS X, and significantly simplifies the way you interact with your Mac.</p><p>The Mac App Store was introduced with OS X 10.6.6, but is now built into Lion, and brings a handful of new features. In-app purchases are now catered for, as are delta updates, whereby when updating an application bought from the Mac App Store, only the sections that have changed are downloaded. </p><p>Push notifications allow developers to bring you important information about their app, even when it\'s not currently open on your machine. For security, Lion also greatly enhances OS X\'s sandboxing function, something Mac App Store downloads will soon be required to use.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%205-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>APP IT UP:</strong> <em>Lion\'s Mac App Store offers new features</em></p><p>A feature that\'s clearly made its way to OS X from iOS is Launchpad. A convenient and versatile application launcher, Launchpad is activated from the Dock or with a gesture and behaves very similar to iOS\'s home screen. Applications bought from the App Store or kept in your Applications folder are present automatically, and programs kept elsewhere can be added by dragging them onto the Launchpad Dock icon.</p><p>Launchpad can display 40 app icons per page, and like iOS\'s home screen, you can swipe between pages. Applications can be reordered and moved from page to page, and also grouped into folders by dragging one icon onto another. A folder can contain up to 32 applications, and is automatically named according to their type, though you can change the suggested title if you wish.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%206-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>IOSESQUE:</strong><em> Lion\'s Launchpad feature is instantly familiar to anyone who has used iOS</em></p><p>Of all the major features in Lion, Launchpad seems to have generated the least enthusiasm among long-time Mac users. </p><p>Yet while it\'s clearly designed to make life easier for those who bought their first Mac because they liked iOS, it could prove more useful than you expect over time. After you\'ve used it for a while, and the apps you need most often but not quite often enough to keep in the Dock are easily accessible on the front page, it might become a useful alternative to typing the name of the app in the Spotlight field for quick access. </p><p>Some users have found a bug where applications can display incorrect icons in Launchpad. We hope this is fixed soon.</p><p>Resume (as in \'pick up where you left off\', not \'résumé\', the American term for a CV) is arguably the most useful addition to Lion. If you quit a Resume-compatible application, when you reopen, it launches in exactly the same state as it was in when you closed it. Windows are reopened, palettes and panes restored and even highlighted text and cursor positions are kept just as they were before. Safari tabs and web pages are also restored, as long as you weren\'t using its Private Browsing feature.</p><p>The feature also works when you shut down or restart your Mac. A new option in the confirmation pop-up asks if you want to reopen windows when you log back in. If you leave this checked (as it is by default), Lion takes a snapshot of your system as it shuts down, restarting in exactly the same state it was in when you closed it. </p><p>Applications are relaunched, windows reopened and documents arranged exactly as they were when you shut down. This is especially useful if you want to install an application or upgrade the system software while you\'re working on something else; there\'s no longer any need to put off restarting until you\'ve finished what you\'re doing.</p><p>It\'s important to note that not every Mac application currently takes advantage of Resume. If you use Google Chrome as your main browser, for example, don\'t expect your currently-open web pages to return after a quit and restart. We hope third-party developers aren\'t slow to take advantage of this extremely useful feature, but until they do, be careful when shutting down or restarting; don\'t simply assume everything will reappear.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%206-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><strong>START AGAIN:</strong> <em>Leave this box checked to restart using Resume</em></p><p>There\'s nothing worse than losing work to a crash or application freeze when you haven\'t saved for a while. You\'ve only got yourself to blame, of course, but that just makes it even more galling. With Auto Save, tapping CMD-S every couple of minutes might become a thing of the past. Applications that have this feature are saved automatically, during pauses in your work or every five minutes if you don\'t take a break. To cut down on wasted disk space, Auto Save preserves changes rather than creating additional copies of the entire document, and does so wholly in the background, so there\'s no spinning beach ball or progress bar.</p><p>Apps designed to take advantage of Lion\'s Auto Save feature include Preview, TextEdit and Apple\'s iWork suite. Documents created using one of these apps have a pull-down menu for a title, giving you the chance to lock it against further automatic saves, duplicate it and keep the original as a template, revert to the last saved version to undo changes, or browse the document\'s states saved in another of Lion\'s key feature, Versions.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%207-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>SAVE IT: </strong><em>In apps that take advantage of Auto Save, the title bar becomes a menu</em></p><p>Lion\'s new Versions feature creates a history of your document as you work on it. A new version is recorded every hour, whenever you make a significant change and when you email, duplicate, lock or revert it using the Auto Save pull-down menu. You can also create a new Version manually using CMD-S; it seems this trusty old keyboard command still has its uses. </p><p>Selecting Browse All Versions from the title menu sets the current document against its previous versions in a Time Machine-like interface. You can revert to an older version if you wish to abandon changes made since, or copy and paste pictures and text; just the thing if you\'ve accidentally cut something you wish you\'d retained.</p><p>Auto Save and Versions won\'t reach their full potential until third-party developers include these new features in their own applications, but given their huge potential for making life easier and more productive, they should be quick to do so.</p><p>Previously, if your Mac suffers a crash from which it can\'t recover, you had to boot from your operating system disc and restart. Obviously, this is impossible in Lion – as the new OS is downloaded from the Mac App Store, there is no operating system disc. </p><p>Thankfully, Apple has thought of that. Lion reserves a small portion (about the size of a CD) of your boot drive as a recovery partition. If you can\'t start your Mac using your usual account, power up holding CMD-R to boot straight into it, or hold ALT and select it from the list of bootable drives. Booting in the recovery partition lets you reinstall Lion, fix a damaged drive using Disk Utility, check email or Apple\'s support site in Safari or restore from a Time Machine backup.</p><p>While the lack of a boot disc makes many users nervous, restarting from a recovery partition is certainly simpler than using an OS disc.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%207-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>LOOK BACK:</strong> <em>Versions uses a Time Machine-like interface</em></p><p>Another new feature appearing in Lion\'s Finder window Side Bar is AirDrop, a handy but limited means of sharing files between Wi-Fi-enabled Macs. Click on AirDrop and your Finder window turns into a radar-like image, with your own Mac at the foot of the window.</p><p> Any Macs within a ten-metre range that also have an AirDrop window open are also shown. To transfer a file to another Mac, you just drag and drop it onto its image in your AirDrop window. There\'s no setting up or configuring to be done, and as transfer is peer-to-peer, you don\'t even need to be on the same Wi-Fi network. It really is that simple.</p><p>Sharing with AirDrop is secure. After dragging a file onto another Mac\'s icon, you\'re asked to confirm you want to send it. The receiver can accept or decline – you can\'t drop files onto another person\'s Mac without permission. Transfer is encrypted, and neither party ever sees the files on the other\'s hard drive.</p><p>But although secure and convenient, AirDrop is also very limited. It can only transfer files between Macs running Lion; it\'s not available for earlier versions of Mac OS, and there\'s no Windows or Linux version for PCs. It\'s a useful feature if you regularly transfer small files between up-to-date Macs, but if you\'re in a mixed Mac and PC environment, or not every nearby Mac has been upgraded to Lion, you\'d better not throw away that USB stick just yet.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%208-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>TRANSFERS:</strong><em> AirDrop is a secure and convenient means of transferring files between Macs, but only if they\'re both running Lion</em></p><p>OS X\'s bundled email client has undergone some radical changes. A new widescreen view gives you a full-height window to view your mail, with received messages listed and previewed in a column on the left. Mailboxes and other folders aren\'t shown by default, but can be opened in another column at the push of a button. A favourites bar gives access to commonly-used folders, and you can customise it by adding new ones.</p><p>Messages can be flagged in seven different colours now, not just red, and the new Conversation feature threads on-going exchanges in chronological order, making them easier to follow. The search engine has had a radical rebuild, making it much easier to find what you\'re looking for. Mail is now compatible with Microsoft Exchange 2010 too.</p><p>Like Finder and iTunes, the button icons in Mail have gone stylishly monochrome, sometimes to the detriment of clarity. How, for example, are you supposed to know that a thumbs-down image means junk mail, or a square icon that looks like a washboard gives you a new note? When you first start using the revamped app, you might have to hover your mouse pointer over the buttons just to see what they do. </p><p>Perhaps it\'s strange that as the rest of Mac OS X becomes more tailored to the novice user, Mail gets more complicated and less instinctive. But Lion\'s email client is undoubtedly more capable than its predecessor, even if it isn\'t always as intuitive.</p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%208-2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>NEW MAIL:</strong> <em>The new release of Apple Mail is more powerful, but less intuitive</em></p><p>The switch-over to Lion has been relatively free of problems, but a few minor maladies are worth mentioning.</p><p>Fans of Apple\'s elegant but limited Front Row application will be disappointed to find it\'s been removed in Lion. We can\'t understand why. It\'s quite capable of running under the new operating system. So much so, in fact, that a Mac user has taken Front Row and its associated components from Snow Leopard and bundled it into an installer. Entitled <a href=\"http://goo.gl/9oSZA\">Front Row Enabler</a>, you can download it if you wish. It worked for us, but install it at your own risk.</p><p>Something that won\'t be returning to Lion is Rosetta, Apple\'s dynamic translator used to run applications written for the older PowerPC architecture on Macs with Intel processors. </p><p>To see if you\'re still running PowerPC apps, open the System Profiler found in Applications > Utilities, click on Applications and sort them according to Kind. If you\'re planning to upgrade to Lion, PowerPC applications must be upgraded or abandoned.</p><p>Some people who use a NAS drive for Time Machine backups find it no longer works after moving to Lion. This is apparently because Apple used a new version of Netatalk that\'s incompatible with the protocols used by most third-party network-attached storage devices. If you\'re in this position, all you can do is check the support site for your NAS drive and wait for an update.</p><p>Finally, the new-look iCal and Address Book applications have not been well received. In yet another nod to iOS, they\'ve been made to look like their real-world counterparts, with iCal sporting a stitched leather finish and a tear where the previous month\'s calendar was ripped away, and Address Book looking like a physical volume, with a bookmark ribbon used to switch from viewing groups on the left page and contacts on the right, to contacts on the left and individual contact cards on the right. It\'s totally unnecessary. </p><p><img alt=\"Mac os x 10.7 review\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/classifications/computing/mac/images/lionreviewpics/Page%209-1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>NASTY:</strong> <em>Do digital productivity applications really need a real-world metaphor in 2011?</em></p><p>In 2011, people are used to using digital calendars and address books – we no longer need a real-world metaphor to remind us what we\'re doing. And in Address Book\'s case, the aesthetics actually detract from its usability, with Snow Leopard\'s handy three-column view abandoned to make way for two facing pages. We hope Apple addresses this very soon.</p><p>The eighth release of OS X takes features developed for iOS and brings them to the Mac, and adds some excellent enhancements of its own. Scrolling now follows iOS protocols, with the user interacting directly with the window\'s contents instead of moving the window itself, and compatible applications can be viewed in Full Screen, with no distractions in your peripheral vision.</p><p>A trio of related features make saving and restarting a simple task. Auto Save means you should never lose work to a crash again, Versions lets you switch back to or take material from an earlier version of a document and Resume means you can close an application or even your whole system and have it reopen in the same state it was in before it closed. Again, these features require compatible applications.</p><p><strong>We liked</strong></p><p>£21 for a new operating system is an incredible bargain, especially considering you can install it on all your Macs; no family licences here. The Recovery Partition is an excellent idea, and is certainly handier than having to find your install disc, restarting with the mouse button down to eject the optical disc drive and then again to boot from the DVD instead of your hard drive.</p><p>OS X\'s new Gestures are extremely useful. They take a while to learn, but after a few days with Lion, they transform the way you interact with your Mac. You might well want to switch to a Magic Trackpad to make sure you get the most out of them. Finally, fusing Spaces, Dashboard and ExposÈ into Mission Control is a masterstroke, which again makes it much easier to interact with your Mac.</p><p><strong>We disliked</strong></p><p>Switching back to a real-world metaphor for iCal and Address Book seems a really odd decision. It might make sense on an iOS device, where you hold it in your hand like a paper calendar or address book, but there\'s no need for it on a Mac. Address Book is actually less usable now, with a useful three-column interface giving way to a two-page view.</p><p>We\'re not convinced that dropping the colour from in-app icons was a good idea either. There were many complaints when iTunes did it a few months ago, and now Finder\'s monochrome sidebars are equally poorly received. In Mail especially, the colourless icons are unclear. A button showing a yellow page, for example, was clearly there to produce a new note, but robbed of its colour, we had to hover over it with our mouse pointer until a pop-up told us what it did.</p><p><strong>Verdict</strong></p><p>Lion is a significant step forward for Mac OS X, but it\'s not without its problems. Features such as Mission Control, Resume, Auto Save and Versions will prove incredibly useful over time. Launchpad may prove its worth, but even if it remains unused, it\'s not in the way. Many Mac owners will miss Rosetta, but its demise was inevitable. Not so Front Row, which didn\'t need to be dropped at all. Maybe Apple will put it in the App Store as a free download.</p><p>Despite a few teething troubles (most notably breaking third-party NAS compatibility and a few questionable interface decisions), Lion is definitely worth the upgrade. Like most OS upgrades it will probably really shine after its second or third update, but unless you\'re running PowerPC applications you can\'t be without, there\'s no need to wait. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e8697d/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Apple+Mac+OS+X+10.7+Lion&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fsoftware%2Foperating-systems%2Fapple-os-x-10-7-lion-982954%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Apple+Mac+OS+X+10.7+Lion&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Fsoftware%2Foperating-systems%2Fapple-os-x-10-7-lion-982954%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877884257/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e8697d/kg/201-221-239-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877884257/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e8697d/kg/201-221-239-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/HuO_PCGGsgs\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/HuO_PCGGsgs/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',31046,NULL,'2011-07-25 15:00:00'),(188,'Review: Apple MacBook Pro 17-inch 2.2GHz','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20234/MAC234.rev_cover.macbkpro17-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Apple\'s most expensive MacBook Pro offers very similar specifications to the high-end 15-inch model. </p><p>Both have a brand-new, second-generation \'Sandy Bridge\' quad-core 2.2GHz Core i7 processor with integrated Intel HD Graphics 3000. </p><p>Both bring us an AMD Radeon HD 6750M discrete graphics processor with 1GB of GDDR5 memory, a 750GB, 5400RPM SATA hard drive, 4GB of 1,333MHz RAM and an internal seven-hour battery. </p><p>And both have a single FireWire 800 port as well as a Thunderbolt port, Intel\'s exciting new I/O technology offering up to 10Gbps transfer speeds in both directions. </p><p>Apart from the screen sizes, the only significant differences between the two high-end off-the-shelf MacBook Pros is that this 17-inch model has three USB ports instead of two, and an ExpressCard / 34 slot instead of an SDXC card reader. </p><p>The 17-inch MacBook Pro is aimed at people who need extreme performance as well as a larger screen. It\'s ideal for graphic designers who need all the screen space they can get and enough processing power to render complex images and artwork.</p><p> Likewise, video editors need enough room to fine-tune their projects without losing sight of the big picture, and enough power to save them out in a reasonable time. </p><p>The Mac isn\'t most people\'s choice of gaming machine, but this one is certainly powerful enough to handle current games, and people who need lots of windows open would welcome the extra screen space. </p><p><strong>Tech Labs</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Tech labs\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Benchmark%20graphics/thinbanner-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Cinebench: Higher is better<br /></strong></p><p><img alt=\"Cinebench\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20234/cinebench-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Doom 3: FPS: Higher is better</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Doom 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20234/doom3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>iTunes encoding</strong></p><p><img alt=\"iTunes\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20234/itunes-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The days when notebooks played second fiddle to desktops are long behind us. Today\'s MacBooks – especially this new MacBook Pro – are powerful enough to use as a main computer, and ideal for those who want a desktop setup but with a Mac they can pick up and use on the move when necessary. But is picking it up and taking it away a problem? How portable can a notebook with a 17-inch screen actually be? </p><p>This is where Apple\'s 17-inch MacBook Pro really shines. Its unibody aluminium construction lends it strength, but keeps it light. At 2.99kg, it\'s only 18% heavier than the 15-inch model, and only marginally more bulky. As long as your notebook bag is big enough to fit it, portability isn\'t a problem.</p><p> It\'s good that the new 17-inch MacBook Pro enjoys parity with the better of the two 15-inch models brought to us by the early 2011 refresh. Before, it had the same specs as the middle of three 15-inch MacBook Pros, which seemed wrong. </p><p>But now, Apple\'s new top-of-the range notebook is hard to beat. It\'s incredibly powerful, has an excellent screen and is beautifully portable for a 17-inch model.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/laptops-portable-pcs/laptops-and-netbooks\">Read more laptop reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e830c6/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16c9c9ae/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Claptops0Eportable0Epcs0Claptops0Eand0Enetbooks0Cacer0Easpire0Eone0E7210E980A2460Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Acer Aspire One 721</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ca2fa5/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Claptops0Eportable0Epcs0Claptops0Eand0Enetbooks0Casus0Ex32a0E980A2480Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Asus X32A</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ef9477/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Claptops0Eportable0Epcs0Claptops0Eand0Enetbooks0Csony0Evaio0Evpc0Ez21v9e0E9833670Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Sony VAIO Z Series</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16ef9478/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Cpc0Emac0Claptops0Eportable0Epcs0Claptops0Eand0Enetbooks0Chp0Eprobook0E5330Am0E9835450Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: HP ProBook 5330m</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Apple+MacBook+Pro+17-inch+2.2GHz&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Flaptops-portable-pcs%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fapple-macbook-pro-17-inch-2-2ghz-982992%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Apple+MacBook+Pro+17-inch+2.2GHz&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fpc-mac%2Flaptops-portable-pcs%2Flaptops-and-netbooks%2Fapple-macbook-pro-17-inch-2-2ghz-982992%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877880973/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e830c6/kg/201-216-239-253-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877880973/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e830c6/kg/201-216-239-253-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/ow-b6Ut7Mrc\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/ow-b6Ut7Mrc/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',6267,NULL,'2011-07-25 14:32:00'),(189,'Review: Olympus ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-54mm F2.8-3.5 II','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Digital%20Camera/DCM%20112/3.%20DCM112.kit_group.dsc4151Olm-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Designed specifically for the Four Thirds SLR system, the Olympus 14-54mm has a useful effective zoom range of 28-108mm. </p><p>Better still, as one of the \'pro\' level lenses in the Zuiko Digital line-up, build quality feels consummately sturdy, and the lens features dust and moisture seals, including a rubber o-ring incorporated into the metal mounting plate.

Despite this, it\'s surprisingly compact and sturdily built.

Another neat touch is that the dual-mode VR has Normal and Active options </p><p><strong>Performance</strong></p><p>Nikon makes one of the best superzoom lenses on the market – the Nikon AF-S DX VR 18-200mm f/3.5-5.6G IF-ED – so the 16-85mm has its work cut out to match it, given that it\'s only about £100 cheaper. </p><p>Sure enough, there are none of the nasty, moustache-shaped distortions for which the 18-200mm is notorious, although the 16-85mm still has some barrel distortion at the wide-angle end. Unlike the bigger 18-200mm, there\'s no zoom creep so tripod-mounted use is much easier. </p><p>We\'ve seen razor-sharp images from several samples of this lens, but the review sample for this test was underwhelming. However, chromatic aberration was almost non-existent. </p><p><strong>Tech Focus…</strong></p><p>For shooting from an idling car, or if you\'re feeling adventurous, a helicopter, the VR II system\'s Active mode works a treat, delivering sharp handheld shots time after time.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/camera-lenses\">Read more camera lens reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc61/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc5e/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Colympus0Ezuiko0Edigital0E140E54mm0Ef20E80E30E50Eii0E9613230Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Olympus ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-54mm F2.8-3.5 II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc64/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Ccanon0Eef0Es0E170E85mm0Ef0E40E50E60Eis0Eusm0E9613180Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc67/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Csigma0E180E50Amm0Ef20E80Eex0Edc0Emacro0E9613390Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Sigma 18-50mm EX DC OS HSM</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc69/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Ctokina0Eat0Ex0E160E28mm0Ef20E80Epro0Efx0E9613530Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Tokina AT-X 16-28mm F2.8 PRO FX</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Nikon+AF-S+DX+16-85mm+F%2F3.5-5.6+G+ED+VR&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fcamera-lenses%2Fnikon-af-s-dx-16-85mm-f-3-5-5-6-g-ed-vr-961320%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Nikon+AF-S+DX+16-85mm+F%2F3.5-5.6+G+ED+VR&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fcamera-lenses%2Fnikon-af-s-dx-16-85mm-f-3-5-5-6-g-ed-vr-961320%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877860857/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e6dc61/kg/201-221-253-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877860857/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e6dc61/kg/201-221-253-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/bAxcAxUtZV4\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/bAxcAxUtZV4/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',4713,NULL,'2011-07-25 11:28:00'),(191,'Review: Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Digital%20Camera/DCM%20112/1.%20DCM112.kit_group.dsc4150Can-200-200.jpg\" /><p>The first step up Canon\'s ladder of standard zoom lenses, at least from the kit lens supplied with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/canon-eos-550d-677890/review\">550D</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/canon-eos-600d-936074/review\">600D</a>, is the EF-S 17-85mm. It\'s better built, with a much sturdier feel than the Canon EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS kit lens for those cameras. </p><p>Improvements include a metal (rather than plastic) mounting plate for fixing the lens to the camera, a focus distance scale that\'s tidily positioned beneath a viewing window, ring-type USM autofocus and a non-rotating front element.</p><p>On top of that, the more generous zoom equates to an effective 27-136mm instead of a mere 29-88mm. Despite its impressive credentials, the EF-S 17-85mm was originally Canon\'s official kit lens supplied with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/canon-eos-50d-458349/review\">EOS 50D</a>, and it\'s starting to show its age compared to the newer lenses. For example, its older-generation Image Stabilizer only delivers a three-stop advantage, whereas the latest edition featured on the humble 18-55mm IS provides a four-stop benefit. </p><p><strong>Performance</strong></p><p>There isn\'t a major increase in image quality compared with Canon\'s relatively cheap EF-S 18-55mm IS lens, and we only noticed a marginal gain in sharpness.

Unlike the Canon and Nikon lenses on test, the Sigma 17-50mm boasts a fast, constant aperture of f/2.8 that remains fixed throughout the zoom range. </p><p>That\'s quite an achievement for a lens that also includes optical image stabilisation. Other finery includes two of Sigma\'s FLD glass elements, which the company claims provides the very best low-dispersion performance to reduce chromatic aberration while enabling maximum light transmission. </p><p><strong>Performance</strong></p><p>The HSM (HyperSonic Motor) autofocus system fitted to this lens isn\'t Sigma\'s best, because there\'s no full-time manual override. Unlike many Sigma HSM lenses, the focus ring rotates during autofocus, so you have to be careful not to foul the action of the focus ring in handheld shooting. </p><p>A drawback of many fast lenses is that images lack a little sharpness and contrast when shooting at the maximum aperture, but the Sigma proved amazingly crisp at f/2.8 throughout. </p><p>Distortion is well controlled, and while there\'s a little colour fringing, it\'s only really noticeable around very high-contrast edges. There\'s also a distinct lack of vignetting, with excellent peripheral illumination in the corners of even wide-angle images.</p><p><strong>Tech Focus…</strong></p><p>The optical stabiliser works well with most Pentax and Sony bodies, but you need to turn off the camera\'s own sensor-shift stabiliser to avoid the two systems conflicting with each other.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/camera-lenses\">Read more camera lens reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc67/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc5e/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Colympus0Ezuiko0Edigital0E140E54mm0Ef20E80E30E50Eii0E9613230Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Olympus ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-54mm F2.8-3.5 II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc61/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Cnikon0Eaf0Es0Edx0E160E85mm0Ef0E30E50E50E60Eg0Eed0Evr0E961320A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Nikon AF-S DX 16-85mm F/3.5-5.6 G ED VR</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc64/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Ccanon0Eef0Es0E170E85mm0Ef0E40E50E60Eis0Eusm0E9613180Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc69/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Ctokina0Eat0Ex0E160E28mm0Ef20E80Epro0Efx0E9613530Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Tokina AT-X 16-28mm F2.8 PRO FX</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Sigma+18-50mm+EX+DC+OS+HSM&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fcamera-lenses%2Fsigma-18-50mm-f2-8-ex-dc-macro-961339%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Sigma+18-50mm+EX+DC+OS+HSM&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fcamera-lenses%2Fsigma-18-50mm-f2-8-ex-dc-macro-961339%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877860853/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e6dc67/kg/201-232-238-245-253-262-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877860853/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e6dc67/kg/201-232-238-245-253-262-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/d_rW2lZXnEQ\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/d_rW2lZXnEQ/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',4691,NULL,'2011-07-25 11:25:00'),(193,'Review: Tokina AT-X 16-28mm F2.8 PRO FX','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Digital%20Camera/DCM%20112/8.%20DCM112.kit_group.dsc4146Tok-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Much bigger than most lenses in the group, and at more than twice the weight of some, the Tokina is a chunky lens. That\'s because while all the other lenses in the group are designed solely for use on cameras with APS-C or Four Thirds sensors, the Tokina is fully compatible with full-frame cameras. </p><p>Essentially, it\'s designed as a full-frame ultra-wide-angle zoom, so why would you want it on your APS-C camera? </p><p>Image quality should be excellent, because you\'re only using the central region of the image circle produced by the lens. And if you\'re thinking of upgrading to a full-frame camera in the future, the lens will still be useful. </p><p>Downsides include no image stabilisation, which is usual for ultra-wide lenses, and there\'s also no filter thread for attaching filters. </p><p><strong>Performance</strong></p><p>Autofocus is based on Tokina\'s new \'silent\' DC motor, which proved fast, quiet and accurate, but not as quiet as the USM, AF-S and HSM competition. </p><p>There\'s no full-time manual override, but the lens does feature Tokina\'s trademark push-pull focus ring for easily switching between autofocus and manual focus. </p><p>Despite being a full-frame lens, we found a drop-off in sharpness between the centre and edges of APS-C format images. Even centre sharpness wasn\'t very impressive, especially at the maximum aperture of f/2.8. </p><p>As expected, vignetting was less pronounced when used on an APS-C camera, but it was still noticeable. </p><p><strong>Tech Focus…</strong></p><p>Most ultra-wide lenses have a filter thread for attaching filters, or at least a gel filter holder at the rear of the lens. The Tokina has neither, making the use of filters tricky.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/world-of-tech/techradar-s-reviews-guarantee-622749\">TechRadar Reviews Guarantee</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/camera-lenses\">Read more camera lens reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc69/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc5e/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Colympus0Ezuiko0Edigital0E140E54mm0Ef20E80E30E50Eii0E9613230Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Olympus ZUIKO DIGITAL 14-54mm F2.8-3.5 II</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc61/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Cnikon0Eaf0Es0Edx0E160E85mm0Ef0E30E50E50E60Eg0Eed0Evr0E961320A0Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Nikon AF-S DX 16-85mm F/3.5-5.6 G ED VR</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc64/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Ccanon0Eef0Es0E170E85mm0Ef0E40E50E60Eis0Eusm0E9613180Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Canon EF-S 17-85mm f/4-5.6 IS USM</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6dc67/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Creviews0Ccameras0Eand0Ecamcorders0Ccameras0Ccamera0Elenses0Csigma0E180E50Amm0Ef20E80Eex0Edc0Emacro0E9613390Creview0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Freviewall/story01.htm\">Review: Sigma 18-50mm EX DC OS HSM</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Tokina+AT-X+16-28mm+F2.8+PRO+FX&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fcamera-lenses%2Ftokina-at-x-16-28mm-f2-8-pro-fx-961353%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Tokina+AT-X+16-28mm+F2.8+PRO+FX&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fcamera-lenses%2Ftokina-at-x-16-28mm-f2-8-pro-fx-961353%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877860850/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e6dc69/kg/221-232-238-245-253-262-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877860850/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e6dc69/kg/221-232-238-245-253-262-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/LcdbUrllPH8\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/LcdbUrllPH8/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',4795,NULL,'2011-07-25 11:23:00'),(194,'Review: Olympus PEN E-P3','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/E-P3_silver__rightside_EW-M1220-XL-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Although from the outset Olympus\'s PEN series of compact system cameras had its fans, it also had its fair share of detractors. The E-P1 (launched in June 2009) for example, had no built-in flash or viewfinder, a dated and somewhat confused menu and a sluggish AF system. </p><p>Subsequent cameras went someway to deal with these points, but to the casual observer the models had little to distinguish themselves from each other. </p><p>With its recent announcement of the PEN E-P3, E-PL3 (L standing for Lite) and the E-PM1 (M for Mini), however, Olympus has attempted to deal with this identity crisis as well as make a few other improvements.</p><p>     <p>While sharing the same basic specs, the three new models are designed to appeal to different users. The PEN E-P3 sits at the top of the range and caters for advanced users, the E-PL3 is in the middle for those perhaps looking to upgrade from a high-end compact model, while the E-PM1 (Mini) is for photographers who want a very a compact camera that accepts interchangeable lenses.</p><p>The Olympus PEN E-P3, aka The PEN or P3, will be on sale at the end of August, but the Lite and Mini variants will be following in late early autumn.</p><p><img alt=\"Olympus pen collection\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/on%20Parade_all-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><h4>Features</h4><p>Like the PEN Lite and Mini cameras, the Olympus P3 has a Four Thirds type 17.3 x 13.0mm Live MOS (CMOS) sensor with 12.3 million effective pixels. </p><p>Olympus has a working agreement with Panasonic and the sensor in the new PEN camera hails from Panasonic\'s factories – it is believed to be the same sensor as in the Panasonic GF3. </p><p>As a compact system camera, the P3 has no reflex mirror, so it employs a contrast detection auto focus (AF) system that uses information from the imaging sensor. The Live MOS device inside the P3 has a fast read-out speed of 120fps, which helps to speed-up the AF. </p><p>Olympus claims that the TruePic VI processing engine in the new PEN cameras is faster than Panasonic\'s Venus Engine VI FHD device, so it can get more speed out of the AF system. Consequently, Olympus believes that the P3 has the world\'s fastest AF when used with its MSC (Movie Stills Compatible) optics. </p><p>Being a Micro Four Thirds model, the P3 can accept lenses with the Micro Four Thirds mount from Olympus and Panasonic.</p><p>In another upgrade to the PEN AF system, the P3 has 35 AF points, which cover all but the outer edges of the imaging frame. Helpfully, Olympus has also added an AF assist light to improve focusing in low light conditions. In addition to the usual single and continuous AF options, the P3 has a Tracking Continuous AF mode (like Panasonic\'s) that allows the user to specify the subject for focus and then leave the camera to keep it sharp as it moves around the scene.</p><p><img alt=\"Olympus pen e-p3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/E-P3_black__front_doublezoom_XL-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Olympus clearly has faith in it TruePic VI processing engine\'s ability to control noise as the P3 has a sensitivity range that runs from ISO 200 to ISO 12,800, with ISO 3200 and above being listed as extension values. </p><h4>Touchscreen</h4><p>Touchscreens can be divided into two types, resistive and capacitive. Resistive screens have two electrically conductive layers that are separated by a narrow gap. When a finger or stylus presses these two layers together, the touch is detected and the device responds accordingly. Panasonic uses resistive touchscreens in its cameras.</p><p>Capacitive screens have an electrically conductive surface coating and touching this with human skin, which is also conductive, changes the capacitance and triggers a response. Apple uses a capacitive screen in its iPhones. </p><p>Devices with capacitive screens cannot be controlled by non-conductive styluses etc, but they tend to be more responsive to finger-touch than resistive screens as they require only a touch rather than a press. </p><p>In a first for the Olympus PEN system, the P3 has a touchscreen. This is a 3in 610,000dot OLED device and unlike other cameras that have a resistive screen, the P3\'s is capacitive like the screen on an iPhone. </p><p>Though it may seem unnecessary to some, when well implemented a touchscreen can really improve a camera\'s handling by allowing quicker access to features and more intuitive control. The E-P3 features touch AF, which instructs the camera to focus on the point in the scene chosen by a touch of a finger, and, like the Panasonic G3 and GF3, it also has a touch shutter. This sets the camera to focus and fire the shutter with a touch of a finger on the screen.</p><p>Helpfully, Olympus has given the P3\'s screen an Anti-Fingerprint Coating that should reduce the amount of smudging on its surface.</p><p>Although it doesn\'t have a viewfinder built-in, the P3 has an accessory port (see below) to accept Olympus\'s optional external electronic viewfinder (EVF). The Viewfinder slots into the P3\'s hotshoe, which means it can\'t be used with an external flashgun, but the P3 also has a flash unit built-in.</p><p><img alt=\"Olympus pen e-p3 accessory port\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/PEN%20P3%20Details/DCM116.lb_150711_gr.olympus_ep3_port-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Another welcome inclusion with the P3 is a two-axis electronic level, which is useful when it\'s essential to keep the horizon level and it operates when the camera is upright or in landscape format.</p><p>While the P3 has lots to offer enthusiast photographers, there are lots of automated modes that help out less experienced photographers. Olympus\'s Live Guide, for example is on hand and works with the touchscreen. The popular Art Filters are also available and can be used completely automatically or in any of the advanced shooting modes. Video can also be recorded in AVCHD or Motion JPEG format.</p><p>Like Olympus\'s earlier PEN cameras the P3 feels sturdily built, with its metal construction giving it a sense of durability.</p><p>In its standard configuration the P3 has a shallow plastic grip on the front that provides just enough purchase for carrying it between shots, but the supplied shoulder strap is a more secure option. Those who prefer a sleeker look can remove the grip, using a coin to loosen the screw. </p><p>Anyone who wants a deeper fingerhold can invest in the optional deeper grip, though at £69.99 it isn\'t cheap for a piece of moulded plastic. This flexibility is a great idea, but we noticed the anodised screw lost a little of its black finish after being loosened and tightened a few times.</p><p><img alt=\"PEN p3 top\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Digital%20Camera/DCM%2096/DCM96.rev_olympus.olymp3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>ABOVE:</strong> <em>The Olympus PEN E-P2</em></p><p><img alt=\"PEN p3 top\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/E-P3_silver__top_EZ-M1442IIR-XL-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>ABOVE:</strong> <em>Olympus\'s new PEN E-P3</em></p><p>The design of the new PEN E-P3 is very similar to that of the E-P2 and E-P1 with a few notable distinctions - including the pop-up flash. Firstly, the mode dial, which is rotated by the thumb of your left hand on the E-P2, has been moved to the right-hand side of the E-P3\'s top plate to make room for the pop-up flash - as on the PEN E-PL2. </p><p>Meanwhile, the rear of the P3 is melding of the P2 and E-PL2, with a long control dial built into the thumbrest. The video activation button is to the left of the thumbrest (and small speaker), putting it within easy reach.</p><p><img alt=\"PEN p3 rear\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/E-P3_black__back-XL-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>ABOVE:</strong> <em>Olympus\'s new PEN E-P3</em></p><p><img alt=\"Olympus pen p2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Digital%20Camera/DCM%2096/DCM96.rev_olympus.olymp2b-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>ABOVE:</strong> <em>The Olympus PEN E-P2</em></p><p>There has been a little further rejigging of the buttons on the back of the E-P3 since the E-P2. The auto exposure and auto focus lock (AEL/AFL) button has gone and the Menu, Info and Function buttons have been switched around. It doesn\'t take users too long to get used to it, but it will make a slight difference to existing users. </p><p>There are two customisable function (Fn 1 and Fn2) buttons, which can be set to access two of the most commonly required features, including AEL/AFL. Oddly, the two lists of available features are very similar but not identical. </p><p><img alt=\"Olympus pen e-p3 top\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/PEN%20P3%20Details/DCM116.lb_150711_gr.kitzone7-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Olympus has given its menu system a much-needed refresh for the P3. It looks much more modern and is easier to navigate, though advanced users still have to activate the Custom menu via the Set-up menu. Once the camera is set-up to the user\'s preferences, however, there is very little reason to visit the menu as the majority of camera settings can be accessed by pressing the OK button and scrolling though the onscreen list.</p><p><img alt=\"Olympus pen e-p3 ok\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/PEN%20P3%20Details/DCM116.lb_150711_gr.olympus_ep3_ok-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The P3\'s touchscreen is also responsive and easy to use. We particularly like that the screen\'s touch-sensitive function can be controlled by touching an icon, which remains active even when the touch feature is deactivated. It\'s surprising that menu and settings selections can\'t be made using the touchscreen though.</p><h4>Ease of use</h4><p>Although most users will find that they can use the P3 straightaway without any reference to the manual, there are a few hidden features that take time to discover. The Highlight and Shadow tone adjustment control, for instance, is found by accessing the exposure compensation facility and then pressing the Info button. Once this is done the user can select whether to brighten or darken the shadows and/or highlights by up to 7 steps.</p><p><img alt=\"Olympus pen e-p3 tone adjustment\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/PEN%20P3%20Details/DCM116.lb_150711_gr.olympus_ep3_curveclose-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Rather than physical filters the Art Filter are processing modes that set the camera to produces images with a particular appearance. They demand a lot of processing power so using them can make the LCD image can become jerky.??</p><p>In summary, the P3 has the best handling of any digital Olympus PEN to date, the buttons and controls are sensibly arranged, the OLED screen provides a clear view even in quite bright light and the menu has a successful makeover. As usual, there are plenty of opportunities to customise the controls and it is well worth experimenting with the various options.</p><p>?<img alt=\"Olympus pen e-p3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PhotoRadar/Olympus/Olympus%20PENS%202011/E-P3_silver__rightside_FL-300R_17mm-XL-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>At the lower sensitivity settings the P3 is capable of resolving an impressive level of detail, on a par with some SLRS that have larger (APS-C sized) sensors. Noise also appears to be pretty well controlled in JPEGs taken at ISO 3200. Luminance noise is visible, but not objectionable and could even be described as the type of grain that you might occasionally want to add to enhance the atmosphere of a shot. </p><p>Push the sensitivity to ISO 6400, however, and noise (and the camera\'s attempts to remove it) becomes more troublesome. Even when sized to make relatively small prints, these images taken with the Noise Reduction set to standard look soft and lack details. At 100% on-screen, there\'s a fair amount of blurring of detail and some image elements lack any definition. We would avoid using sensitivity settings of ISO 6400 or higher. To be fair to Olympus, every setting from ISO 3200 upwards is outside of the native range.</p><p>At the time of writing Olympus had still not made its raw conversion software for the P3 available and it will be interesting to compare the JPEG results with the simultaneously captured raw files. </p><h4>Colour</h4><p>Our images reveal that the E-P3 generally handles colours well and photographs look natural, but have punch straight from the camera. The general purpose ESP metering system also takes most situations in its stride and the P3\'s wide dynamic range means that bright areas don\'t burn out unexpectedly. The tone adjustment facility proves useful in very high contras scenes, although not surprisingly, applying the maximum level of shadow brightening and highlight darkening results in flat images that have the typical HDR (high dynamic range) appearance.</p><h4>Auto focus</h4><p>Olympus\'s improved AF system is very fast in good light, but when light levels fall it goes the same way as most other contrast detection systems and becomes slower and hesitant. The tracking AF system can also only cope with relatively slow moving subjects and it isn\'t a viable option for sports photographers.</p><h4>Dynamic range</h4><p>Although the P3\'s tonal adjustment feature proves useful in high contrast situations, the P3 has an impressively wide dynamic range, especially for a Four Thirds camera. Highlights don\'t burn out too quickly and shadows don\'t block-up earlier than they should so that images have a full range of tones with subtle gradations.</p><p>As part of our image quality tests, we shot our resolution chart using the P3 with the with the Olympus M. Zuiko 14-42mm f/3.5-5.6 II lens mounted. </p><p>If you view our crops of the resolution chart\'s central section at 100% (or Actual Pixels) you will see that, for example, at ISO 200 the Olympus P3 is capable of resolving up to 24 (line widths per picture height x100) in its highest quality JPEG files. </p><p>Examining images of the chart taken at each sensitivity setting reveals the following

Although at 12.3 million, the effective pixel count isn\'t the highest, the rest of the specification is impressive with all the current must have features, including sensor-shifting image stabilization, sensor cleaning, manual exposure control, automated shooting, Art Filters and Full HD video recording. </p><p>The P3 is also well made and comfortable to hold with sensibly arranged controls and lots of opportunity to customize it to the user\'s preferences. All this means that while inexperienced users should be able to pick up the camera and start shooting straight away, enthusiasts have all the control they want and can set-up it up to suit their style.</p><h4>We liked</h4><p>The extensive range of control and the excellent quality output at low sensitivity. Although it is an expensive extra, keeping the electronic viewfinder (EVF) as an optional extra means that the camera is smaller and lighter than it would be with a viewfinder built-in.</p><h4>We disliked</h4><p>High sensitivity images lack detail and can only be used at a small size. The tone adjustment feature is rather hidden, but very effective.</p><h4>Verdict</h4><p>This is the first time that Olympus has used a touchscreen in a compact system camera and on the whole it has been well implemented, but it would be nice to be able to choose to make settings adjustments (other than the Live Guide options) using it. </p><p>At around £200, the optional electronic viewfinder for the P3 isn\'t cheap, but by not including one in the camera body, Olympus has been able to keep the price of the P3 down and maintain its rectangular, compact camera-like form. It also means that when the new improved EVF that we have been promised comes along next year, users will be able to upgrade to a better unit rather than have to go to the expense of buying a completely new camera. </p><p>Those who don\'t want a viewfinder, will find that the P3\'s OLED screen provides a very clear view in many situations.</p><p>Provided the sensitivity is kept below ISO 3200, the P3 produces superb images, that are well exposed, have lots of sharp detail and pleasant colours.</p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/olympus-pen-e-pl2-942910/review\">Olympus Pen E-PL2 review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/olympus-pen-e-p2-669794/review\">Olympus PEN E-P2 review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/olympus-pen-e-p1-658016/review\">Olympus Pen E-P1 review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/digital-slrs-hybrids/panasonic-g3-954028/review\">Panasonic G3 review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/compact-cameras/samsung-nx11-942926/review\">Samsung NX11 review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/cameras-and-camcorders/cameras/compact-cameras/sony-nex-5-702353/review\">Sony NEX-5 review</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/best-compact-system-camera-2011-10-reviewed-and-rated-960832\">Best Compact System Camera 2011: 10 reviewed and rated</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/photography-video-capture/cameras/best-compact-camera-2011-25-reviewed-and-rated-963985\">Best compact camera 2011: 25 reviewed and rated</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415090/s/16e6b5bf/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Review%3A+Olympus+PEN+E-P3&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fdigital-slrs-hybrids%2Folympus-pen-e-p3-982069%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Review%3A+Olympus+PEN+E-P3&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Freviews%2Fcameras-and-camcorders%2Fcameras%2Fdigital-slrs-hybrids%2Folympus-pen-e-p3-982069%2Freview%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dreviewall\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877660519/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e6b5bf/kg/201-216-253-260-264/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/108877660519/u/49/f/415090/c/669/s/16e6b5bf/kg/201-216-253-260-264/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~4/Q7fX_pNZh-o\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/tech-reviews/~3/Q7fX_pNZh-o/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/reviews\n',30663,NULL,'2011-07-25 10:49:00'),(195,'Review: InFocus SP8600','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Home%20Cinema%20Choice/HCC%20198/HCC198.Infocus.wood01-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Usually projectors that cost less than £800 are either aimed at the business/education markets or absolutely rubbish. And there can be no hiding place for shoddiness when you\'re watching a picture that\'s 100-inch wide or more. </p><p>With this in mind, I was wary of the InFocus SP8600. But then scepticism changed to enthusiasm when I found out it uses a DarkChip 3 (DC3) chipset.</p><p>This is a generation on from the DarkChip 2 system usually found in budget DLP PJs (such as the recently reviewed <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/projectors/benq-w1100-968860/review\">BenQ W1100</a>), and typically delivers benefits over the DC2 in terms of colour response, noise levels and, especially, contrast. </p><p>The other key part of the SP8600\'s optical system is a three-speed, six-segment (RYGCMB) colour wheel, which should help single-chip DLP\'s rainbow effect. </p><p>Colours, meanwhile, ought to benefit from the inclusion of UNISHAPE lamp technology – here, the lamp continually adjusts its output to match the colour segment in play on the colour wheel. </p><p>Meanwhile, the SP8600\'s connectivity includes a handy two HDMIs and a 12V trigger output. In short, there\'s really nothing on the SP8600\'s spec sheet that betrays its decidely cheap market position. </p><p>Maybe its build quality is shoddy? It\'s certainly not the prettiest projector around, with some rather plasticky, gloss-free black bodywork. But it\'s small enough to store in a cupboard when not in use, and it\'s got sufficient curves not to look ugly when sat on a coffee table. </p><p>The SP8600 backs up its usefulness in relatively \'rough and ready\' environments by carrying a built-in speaker system, leaving an 1800 Lumens brightness output figure as the only thing concerning me on its spec sheet. A figure this high can be a good thing with a \'normal\', more expensive projector. But the concern with a model as cheap as the SP8600 is that its brightness will overwhelm its contrast, leading to poor black levels. </p><p>Setting up the machine reveals that it doesn\'t have any vertical optical image shift. This is entirely normal at the SP8600\'s price point, but I mention it because it means many people will have to use keystone correction to straighten the sides of their picture – a process which effectively results in distorting the source image a little. </p><p>Optical zoom is limited, too, at just 1.2x, but the SP8600 does provide plenty of fine tuning options, including gamma controls and colour management. </p><p>Tech Labs</p><p><img alt=\"Tech labs\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/TechRadar/Benchmark%20graphics/thinbanner-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Power consumption: Watts</strong><br />White screen: 241<br />Test footage: 242</p><p>Power consumption increases to 275W with \'Boost\' lamp mode activated. There\'s a minimal difference with movie footage – consumption stays the same regardless of content.</p><p><strong>Contrast ratio</strong><br />Claimed: 5,000:1<br />Measured: 2,100:1</p><p>In the default \'Bright\' mode, we measured contrast at 2,100:1, with luminance at 36.4fL. Post calibration, contrast reduced to 1,200:1.</p><p><strong>Colour temperature: Kelvin</strong><br />Normal: 6,700K<br />Cool: 7,400K<br />Cooler: 8,100K<br />High Cool: 8,500K<br />Lamp Native: 6,700K<br />Warm: 5,100K</p><p>\'Normal\' picture mode gave the most accurate colour temperature.</p><p><img alt=\"InFocus sp8600\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Home%20Cinema%20Choice/HCC%20198/HCC198.Infocus.02-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>As hoped, the DC3 chipset helps the SP8600 perform ridiculously well for its money. Detail reproduction from the stellar Blu-ray of the Coen brothers\' <em>True Grit</em> is superb, with, for instance, the textures in background wallpapers and every strand of the film\'s unfeasible amounts of facial hair being excellently rendered. </p><p>The image\'s contrast is exceptional for a projector at this price point, too. The high brightness rating pushes whites and bright colours, as expected but, contrary to my fears, it doesn\'t stop black levels during dark scenes from looking reasonably believable and natural. There are plenty of £1,000-plus projectors that don\'t deliver dark scenes such as <em>True Grit</em>\'s nighttime shack shoot-out as convincingly as does the SP8600. </p><p>Motion is handled well, with no severe motion blur or judder issues, and rainbow noise is only noticeable when very bright objects appear against very dark backgrounds. Which is to say, not very often. </p><p>For the most part, other types of noise, such as dot crawl and grain, are decently suppressed. The only bizarre exception appeared during one of my favourite test scenes, the main card game in <em>Casino Royale</em> (the Daniel Craig version). During this sequence, the heavily filtered skin tones broke down into quite excessive blocking noise – a phenomenon I couldn\'t repeat with any other disc. And I tried a lot of \'em. </p><p>There must be something about that <em>Casino Royale</em> colour tone specifically that upsets the SP8600. Thankfully for fans of the Bond movie, InFocus has developed a firmware fix you can download and apply to the projector yourself that can kick the noise into touch. </p><p>Aside from the minor rainbowing and fixable noise issue, the only complaint I can level at the SP8600\'s pictures is that dark scenes look slightly hollow, thanks to a shortage of shadow detail. Cue a reminder of the SP8600\'s sub-£800 price – I expect issues like that at this price point. But I don\'t expect a performance so rewarding. </p><p>The InFocus is therefore a home cinema bargain of quite ridiculous proportions.

The TP-Link TL-WR1043ND - one heck of a mouthful - isn\'t actually a dual-band router; it\'s just a lowly single-band. Surely that means it has no chance against the dual-band devices in this test. </p><p>Well, no. In fact, it\'s quite the opposite. Although the TP-Link doesn\'t benefit from the 5GHz transmission band, it has a crude way of making up for this, using three antennas to ramp the standard 2.4GHz signal to its maximum. And it works, with the fastest recorded transmission speed of the 1GB test file over wireless. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/modem-routers/tp-link-tl-wr1043nd-956528/review\">Read the full TP-Link TL-WR1043ND review </a></p><p><strong>The best wireless router is...<br /></strong></p><p>There\'s some good news to be had from this test - no matter which router you choose, there\'s a clear advantage to upgrading an ageing router with a newer, faster one. The difference is noticeable at just two metres, and at 10 metres, with a couple of heavy-duty walls in the way, it\'s quite dramatic. </p><p>In both cases, a Wireless G router was around 10 times slower than the best-performing Wireless N router. If you\'re using wireless a lot, then a Wireless N router is an essential upgrade. </p><p>Some of them perform marginally better than others, so rather than concentrate solely on performance you need to factor in what sort of features they offer and how easy they are to setup and use - the difference in the test was quite substantial. </p><p><strong>Value award: TP-Link TL-WR104 3ND </strong></p><p>With one of the fastest performance at both short and long range, for the cheapest price. TP-Link might not be a household name at the moment, having previously focused on business-orientated products, but it\'s now moving into the consumer market. Judging by the ease of use, excellent performance and competitive price of the TL-WR1043ND, we\'re sure it\'s going to do well. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 4/5 </strong></p><p><strong>Editor\'s choice: FRITZ!Box Fon WLAN 7390</strong></p><p> The FRITZ!Box Fon WLAN 7390 might be expensive, but it\'s cash well spent. The sheer amount of features this router offers and its impressive performance put it well ahead of the competition. It combines some of the best features of professional offi ce-based routers with the user-friendliness we\'ve come to expect from the top home wireless routers. </p><p><strong>Verdict: 4.5/5</strong></p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/16a06723/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/b44f3ff/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Crouters0Estorage0Chow0Eto0Ehack0Eyour0Erouter0E6971930Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Guide: How to hack your router</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/c0ce1a5/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Crouters0Estorage0Cupgrading0Eto0Ea0Ewireless0En0Erouter0Ewhat0Eto0Elook0Efor0E70A320A60Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">In Depth: Upgrading to a Wireless N router: what to look for</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/e8fd73f/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30Ck0EuBkaBNYKw0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">In Depth: Best NAS drive: 8 of the best on test</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/162fce71/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Crouters0Estorage0Chow0Eto0Ehack0Eyour0Ewireless0Erouter0Efirmware0E9694860Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to hack your wireless router firmware</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Best+wireless+router+2011%3A+8+reviewed&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fnetworking%2Frouters-storage%2Fbest-wireless-router-2011-8-reviewed-973165%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Buying+Guide%3A+Best+wireless+router+2011%3A+8+reviewed&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fnetworking%2Frouters-storage%2Fbest-wireless-router-2011-8-reviewed-973165%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106217341771/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/16a06723/kg/188-201-216-221-253-259-260/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106217341771/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/16a06723/kg/188-201-216-221-253-259-260/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/networking/~4/k2HExyuqDNg\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/networking/~3/k2HExyuqDNg/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/networking\n',14437,NULL,'2011-07-13 10:30:00'),(197,'Tutorial: How to set up an iPhone Personal Hotspot','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20234/MAC234.tut_person.macbook_pro-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Personal Hotspot is a new feature in iOS 4.3 that enables you to use an iPhone 4 or 3GS to get other devices – such as your MacBook or iPad – online wherever there\'s phone reception. </p><p><p>While you\'ve been able to do this before in the shape of tethering, Personal Hotspot is less limited on the iPhone 4 – you can attach up to five devices using USB, Bluetooth or Wi-Fi.

In this world of locked-down operating systems, proprietary software and rights-removed content, anything that gives us control over our hardware is a good thing. </p><p><p>One such area is the world of wireless router hacking. You might not have come across it before, but it\'s a well-established niche that provides fresh, Linux-powered firmware for a wide range of wireless routers, which wouldn\'t necessarily get updated otherwise. </p><p>It\'s something you should be interested in: it gives you total control over your wireless routers, and it\'s fun. </p><p><strong>Suitably scared </strong></p><p>Before you dip a toe into these murky waters, you should be aware of the potential dangers. Router hacking isn\'t without its risks - if you try to flash a router with the wrong firmware, you\'ll brick it and end up with something that\'s about as useful as a concrete kite. Because of this, we strongly recommend that you don\'t try it if you only have one router to hand. </p><p>However, if you have a suitable old one lying around, you\'ll be able to revitalise it with a raft of new features that might even push your current router into the background. </p><p>The idea here is simple: you circumvent the firmware upgrade process of an existing router to inject and run your own feature-packed software.</p><p> Over the years, certain manufacturers have made this job easier by making their router firmware and chipset software open source, thereby making it easier to implement third-party versions. This has led to the creation of a number of router-hacking projects. We\'ll be looking at the benefits of some of the most common ones, because they tend to cater for different segments of the market. </p><p><strong>WRT or WRT? </strong></p><p><img alt=\"OpenWRT\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make8.openwrt-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>In the world of router hacking, the main branches of firmware code are <a href=\"https://openwrt.org/\">OpenWRT</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ddwrt.com/\">DD-WRT</a>. </p><p>For our walkthrough, we\'re going to concentrate on DD-WRT, which tends to be more end-user orientated. Its main aim is to provide a working firmware that you can actually install. </p><p>OpenWRT takes a slightly more high-brow approach, wanting to provide framework and source code support for embedded devices that also happen to be gateways and wireless routers. Having said that, many devices have ready-compiled OpenWRT firmware, with comprehensive installation guides provided. </p><p>Going back to DD-WRT, the first and most important step is to identify your router\'s make and model. Make sure you\'ve got the exact one - there may be several with similar model numbers and designs. Doing this will provide you with the correct firmware and tell you exactly how it should be installed. </p><p>It\'s important that you follow the installation instructions to the letter - if you\'re told to do a power cycle or reset, do it. These instructions are linked to clearing the NVRAM that stores tables and other settings. If these aren\'t cleared, they can play havoc with the new firmware, and cause you headaches trying to work out the source of the problem. </p><p><strong>Failure state </strong></p><p>Oddly, it can be quicker to come from the other direction and check if you have an incompatible router. There\'s a <a href=\"http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Known_incompatible_devices\">list of known incompatible devices here</a>. </p><p>There are some quick rules that can quickly eliminate certain models from your search. For the UK, it\'s important to note that routers with a built-in ADSL modem won\'t work for DD-WRT. Don\'t despair, though - owners of ADSL routers can try <a href=\"http://www.routertech.org/\">www.routertech.org</a>, which supports various models that use the Texas Instrument AR7WRD platform. There\'s a <a href=\"http://www.routertech.org/faq/firmware/compatible-routers/\">list of compatible devices here.</a> It isn\'t exhaustive, but it\'s worth a look. </p><p>If your model isn\'t listed as incompatible, don\'t get your hopes up just yet. The list also includes technical limitations for devices: less than 4MB of flash or less than 16MB RAM means you\'re out of luck unless it\'s a Broadcom device. Texas Instruments, Marvel, Ubicom, Realtek and Freescale chipsets are also incompatible. </p><p>To find out which chipset your router uses, look on the back of the unit for its FCC ID number, then search for this on <a href=\"http://www.fcc.gov/\">http://fcc.gov</a>. This is a US database of electronic devices bound by law to submit to radio regulation. </p><p>The device\'s FCC entry will include photos of its internals, from which you can identify the manufacturer of the main IC and flash IC. If that doesn\'t work then you can always crack that hardware open and have a look inside for yourself. </p><p>By this point you should have either eliminated your router or confirmed that it\'s supported, but there\'s still a grey area of partially supported, or work-in-progress status devices. For routers in this bracket, forums are the best places to monitor progress. </p><p><strong>Unto the breach</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Complete\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make8.done-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Let\'s assume we\'ve had good news and our router is compatible. We\'ve dug up an old Linksys WRT54GS v6 for this project, because its firmware installation process is relatively involved.</p><p> Installing the firmware can be a simple update process, or a multi-stage affair that requires the use of a \'kill\' app to terminate the old software, with the new software transferred via a TFTP utility. If you\'ve found your router on the list of compatible devices, or found a suitable forum post that outlines the installation process, then you\'re ready to go. </p><p>With DD-WRT, you\'ll find a host of builds and variants of the firmware. Many routers require a specific or later revision to be installed. This should be easy enough. The other element is based on the amount of VRAM and RAM a router has. Routers with sub-4MB VRAM are restricted to the \'micro\' builds rather than OpenVPN, STD, \'big\' or \'mega\' builds. </p><p>This shouldn\'t make much difference, especially if you\'re just trying it out, but you might want to add more features at a later date. For instance, the mini build has specific variants that add hotspot, USB and NAS support. Having said that, even the base micro version provides most of the features you\'re likely to need, including repeater features, QoS, SPI firewall, UPnP, WPA1/2 support, bandwidth monitoring and more. </p><p><strong>Changing firmware </strong></p><p><strong>Give your old router a new lease of life with a software upgrade </strong></p><p><strong>1. Router revisions </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make8.step01-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The first step is to identify your router. Go to <a href=\"http://www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database\">www.dd-wrt.com/site/support/router-database</a> and search for the make and model. It\'s not always straightforward - we had a Netgear WG602, which initially looked like it might be compatible. However, closer examination showed that it was an original v1 revision. The compatible v3 and v4 versions are white. </p><p><strong>2. Identify your model </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make8.step02-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>An alternative way to identify the model is to look at the huge list of <a href=\"http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Supported_Devices\">routers hosted on this page</a>. You need to find the manufacturer and scan down the list of FCC ID codes. You also need to double-check <a href=\"http://www.dd-wrt.com/wiki/index.php/Hardware-specific#Hardware-specific\">the hardware-specific list here</a>, which will let you know if your particular router needs its own unique install. </p><p><strong>3. Reset cycle </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make8.step03-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Before installing, do a 30-30-30 reset cycle. This is an important step, which involves powering the unit up and pressing the reset switch for 30 seconds. While pressing reset, disconnect the power and hold for 30 more seconds. Still holding the reset button, reconnect the power and hold for 30 more seconds. This is often accompanied by all the LEDs flashing. </p><p><strong>4. Set the IP </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 4\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make8.step04-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Once the router has been reset, you\'re ready to connect your router to the PC you\'re using via a wired Ethernet cable. Ideally, you need to set your PC\'s IP to a static one, which helps to eliminate another area of potential issues. You should set it to either 192.168.0.11 or 192.168.1.11, depending on its base range (usually the latter). </p><p><strong>5. Flash time </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 5\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make8.step05-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>For a number of routers, at this stage you can use the standard web-based interface to install the DD-WRT firmware provided by the database. Wait for it to install (up to five minutes), perform a hard reset and you\'re done. For our Linksys model, we also needed to use pre-install firmware, which sets the stage for the full firmware update.</p><p> <strong>6. The scary bit </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 6\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20308/PCP308.make8.step06-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The final DD-WRT firmware is installed using a TFTP tool - a Windows GUI version is provided. Enter the 192.168.1.1 address, a blank password and choose the correct firmware. Power cycle the router, wait two seconds and click \'Upgrade\'. Wait five minutes. If you can now access the router on 192.168.1.1, do a power cycle and a final 30-30-30 reset.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/162fce71/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/b44f3ff/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Crouters0Estorage0Chow0Eto0Ehack0Eyour0Erouter0E6971930Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Guide: How to hack your router</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/c0ce1a5/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Crouters0Estorage0Cupgrading0Eto0Ea0Ewireless0En0Erouter0Ewhat0Eto0Elook0Efor0E70A320A60Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">In Depth: Upgrading to a Wireless N router: what to look for</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/e8fd73f/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30Ck0EuBkaBNYKw0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">In Depth: Best NAS drive: 8 of the best on test</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/16a06723/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Crouters0Estorage0Cbest0Ewireless0Erouter0E20A110E80Ereviewed0E9731650Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Buying Guide: Best wireless router 2011: 8 reviewed</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Tutorial%3A+How+to+hack+your+wireless+router+firmware&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fnetworking%2Frouters-storage%2Fhow-to-hack-your-wireless-router-firmware-969486%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Tutorial%3A+How+to+hack+your+wireless+router+firmware&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fnetworking%2Frouters-storage%2Fhow-to-hack-your-wireless-router-firmware-969486%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106215652247/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/162fce71/kg/201-221-239/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/106215652247/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/162fce71/kg/201-221-239/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/networking/~4/DxSOFI2hAdI\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/networking/~3/DxSOFI2hAdI/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/networking\n',12966,NULL,'2011-06-26 11:00:00'),(199,'Tutorial: The complete guide to AirPlay','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.elgato-200-200.jpg\" /><p>AirPlay was originally demoed by Steve Jobs during the announcement of the new Apple TV, but then its memory slipped away. Maybe it was the long wait for iOS 4.2 that dulled its impact, or perhaps it was the lack of AirPlay-compatible devices on the market. Either way, this is a technology to shout about. </p><p>While streaming a video from your iPhone to your Apple TV (as shown by Steve) is great, there are many more uses for AirPlay, as you will find out here. This includes the ability to stream music to every room in your home without wires.</p><p>Of course, as we mentioned before, there are few AirPlay devices on the market at the moment and they\'re likely to be fairly expensive when they do arrive, so we\'ve looked at a number of AirPlay alternatives you might want to try out using some kit you may already own. </p><p><strong>What is AirPlay?</strong> </p><p>Apple\'s first real foray into streaming digital media wirelessly was with the AirTunes technology found within its AirPort Express Base Station. The technology wasn\'t widely promoted and required a headphone jack running to the line-in port on a compatible speaker system in order to stream music from your Mac. </p><p>Then, with the launch of the new Apple TV and iOS 4.2, AirTunes became AirPlay, a more advanced adaptation of the technology that enables the streaming of audio, video and images between computers, iPhones, iPads and TVs without the need for cables. </p><p>Previously, companies such as Sonos ruled the home-streaming market but now Apple has made multi-room audio a more affordable option than buying a complete system. </p><p>As this feature will explain, you will likely have a number of machines that can help you create a network of AirPlay speakers and devices and, with a little work, you can even bring non-AirPlay devices into the mix. </p><p>In layman\'s terms, AirPlay is a way for you to control the media you play and the devices you play it on from one central location and, most importantly, without wires. For example, let\'s say you start watching the latest episode of <em>30 Rock</em> on your iPhone while on the bus. The episode hasn\'t quite finished by the time you get home so, using AirPlay, you can drop onto the couch and stream the remainder of the episode from your iPhone to your Apple TV.</p><p><img alt=\"iPhone\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.iphone_hor-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The same applies to music: using AirPlay compatible devices, your Apple TV and available Macs, you can send music to speakers located anywhere in your home or office, even multiple speakers in multiple rooms. </p><p><strong>What you\'ll need </strong></p><p>You probably have AirPlay ready to go without knowing it. You\'ll need the latest iTunes and the most recent iOS software for your devices. </p><p>To make sure you\'re up to date, run Software Update. Next, connect your iPhone, iPod or iPad to your Mac and click on the Check For Update button in the Summary window in iTunes. If there\'s a new version of the iOS software, download and install it.</p><p><img alt=\"Apple tv 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.tv_apple2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Finally, if you\'re using an Apple TV, turn it on and head to the Settings screen. Click on the Update Software option to ensure you\'re up to date. You should now be AirPlay compatible in the software stakes - now for the hardware side. </p><p>The centrepiece of your AirPlay experience will likely be your Mac. From iTunes 10 you can push media to any connected devices such as Apple TV, or compatible third-party speakers. However, there are ways to include non-AirPlay devices. </p><p>AirPlay works best using Wi-Fi, so ideally you\'ll have an existing network set up. However, you can go via Ethernet, but it won\'t be as impressive as the ability to stream from iPhones, iPods and the iPad. </p><p>Assuming you have a Wi-Fi network up and running, the more AirPlay compatible devices you own the better your experience will be. </p><p>The simplest setup will be a Mac, Apple TV and iPhone connected to the same network. Using this setup, you\'ll not only be able to watch movies from your Mac on your Apple TV but you\'ll also be able to control them with Apple\'s Remote app for iPhone, as well as stream video to your TV from your iPhone. </p><p>And why not add an iPad plus multiple speakers that are AirPlay-compatible or connected via an AirPort Express Base Station? AirPort Express Base Stations appear as AirPlay devices in iTunes, as do compatible hardware devices. </p><p><strong>Streaming audio </strong></p><p>Once you\'re connected to various rooms in the house, you can stream to all or some of your speakers. Let\'s say you\'re listening to a podcast in front of your Mac and decide to make a cup of tea. Rather than pause the podcast until you return, you can send it via AirPlay to the speakers in your kitchen and continue listening while the kettle boils. </p><p>AirPlay is also great for parties, allowing you to stream music to rooms containing compatible speakers. If you\'re using AirPlay with an AirPort Express Base Station you can even send audio to multiple speakers using an adapter to split the signal into two and run an audio jack to each set of speakers. </p><p>As well as accessing your iTunes content and music stored on your iPhone or iPad, you can use music apps such as Pandora to stream music to your AirPlay speakers or Apple TV. And as more and more applications catch on, it won\'t be long before most radio and music apps can push their media to different rooms in your home. </p><p><strong>Streaming video and slideshows </strong></p><p>As well as music, you can also stream movies and slideshows from your iPhone or iPad to the Apple TV and, with any luck, we\'ll soon be seeing AirPlay-compatible digital picture frames as well. </p><p>At present there are no AirPlay-enabled video devices on the market, so you\'re limited to streaming video to your Apple TV-connected HDTV, but there are a number of sources to stream from. </p><p><img alt=\"Airplay 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.airplay_2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Firstly, you can send video from iTunes on your Mac straight to your Apple TV without having to search for files via the Apple TV interface. Simply select your Apple TV from the AirPlay menu in iTunes and you\'re good to go. </p><p>Then there\'s streaming of videos on your iPhone and iPad via AirPlay, as we\'ve discussed already. You can also stream video and audio from YouTube via an iOS device by tapping on the AirPlay icon that appears on the video window. Certain compatible apps can also stream video to Apple TV, including the new iPad newspaper <em>The Daily</em>. </p><p>Using an app called AirVideo from InMethod (£1.79), users can even stream video from their Mac to their iPad or iPhone using AirPlay. An app called SlideShow Remote by LogicInMind (£2.99) allows for streaming of Microsoft PowerPoint presentations from iPhone and iPad to Apple TV via AirPlay; another app called Twonky Mobile by PacketVideo (£1.79) offers AirPlay streaming from iPhone, iPad, Mac and even Android devices. </p><p>Basically, wherever you see the AirPlay icon you can select a device to stream media to, and thanks to iOS 4.3 there are more apps with this functionality appearing every day. </p><p><strong>Controlling AirPlay </strong></p><p>To control your AirPlay experience the best method is to use Apple\'s free Remote app for iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. When connected to the same network as your AirPlay devices, Remote can send music from your iTunes library to speakers, as well as control playback. You can also choose which speakers and devices to send media to and from your iPad. </p><p><img alt=\"Airplay 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.airplay_1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Once you\'ve selected the iTunes library you\'re playing the media from, you can control the volume of each device. Media stored in iTunes can be played from Remote and sent to your Apple TV or speakers. This includes movies, TV shows, podcasts and audiobooks that can be streamed across your home and, if you\'re in front of your Apple TV, you can choose to control it from your iPhone or iPad using Remote. </p><p>The interface makes it easier to browse and search the Apple TV, and you can use touch gestures to move between menus and select media. </p><p><strong>Compatible devices and alternate options <br /></strong></p><p>Any wireless Apple product will work with AirPlay, but there are some third-party speakers that will also do the job. Because Apple has partnered with a company called BridgeCo, hardware manufacturers are able to license the AirPlay technology from Apple for inclusion in their devices. </p><p>Companies such as Denon, who already make use of BridgeCo hardware in their speakers, can update firmware in order to make a device AirPlay compatible and has done so with a number of its products.</p><p>Other big players including iHome, Bowers and Wilkins, Klipsch, Marantz and JBL all have AirPlay-enabled speakers in the pipeline that should be available this year. If you\'re waiting for the launch of compatible AirPlay devices or you don\'t want to shell out for a new set of speakers in every room, there\'s a more cost-effective option. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.rogueamoeba.com/\">Rogue Amoeba software</a> makes two apps that can harness the features of AirPlay and turn existing speakers into remote devices. </p><p>AirFoil provides a similar interface to the AirPlay menu in iTunes and allows you to select speakers and devices including your Mac, Apple TV, speakers connected to AirPort Express Base Stations as well as laptops and other Macs. To turn another Mac into an available speaker you need to run the AirFoil Speakers app so that it can be discovered. Using the line-out socket on this Mac you can then connect to non-AirPlay speakers and stream music to them in the same way you would an AirPlay device. </p><p>AirFoil doesn\'t just handle iTunes music, you can send audio from any app running on your Mac or all system audio to your remote speakers. This is ideal for playing web videos or other streaming content from the web, or using other music apps such as Spotify that don\'t support AirPlay. </p><p>There\'s also an app for iPhone and iPad called Reemote for Airfoil by Kai Aras (£2.99) that lets you control AirFoil and select which speakers to use as well as control volume and playback. The benefit of using AirFoil with AirPlay and your existing devices is that, with devices you already own, you can create remote speakers without having to buy anything new. </p><p>If you\'re already using wireless speakers that are not AirPlay compatible you can still keep them on your network and use them as normal for streaming web radio and iTunes music, but also use the line-in port to send audio from a computer or Airport Express. </p><p>During the writing of this feature our AirPlay only setup included an iMac in the study streamed to a speaker in the kitchen connected via AirPort Express. It also streamed to an Apple TV in the living room, connected to an HDTV and surround sound system, with everything controlled via the Remote app for both iPhone and iPad. </p><p>By using AirFoil and AirFoil Speakers, however, we added a speaker in the bathroom and bedroom using a MacBook and a Mac mini. While this isn\'t an ideal solution, it\'s possible to connect speakers across your home without having to use AirPlay-enabled devices.</p><p>Ideally, a wireless AirPlay speaker in every room should be your first choice as the ease of setup and control is second to none. </p><p><strong>Next steps </strong></p><p>There\'s no doubt that AirPlay will continue to develop as Apple adds new software, hardware and features, so now is certainly the time to invest in the technology around your home. Even if you start with a two room setup, you can add more speakers later. </p><p>As we mentioned before, an Apple TV or AirPort Express in each room could be a simple way to use existing non-AirPlay speakers in your setup and the dream setup would be an HDTV and Apple TV in each location. With HD displays offered at an affordable price these days, you could kit out a room for less than £200. </p><p>The beauty of AirPlay is its flexibility, as you upgrade your iOS devices, television and speakers it will continue to work, even if your home or technology collection grows. The technology is, to quote an Apple term, almost \'magical\' in the way it works and, if you hadn\'t considered it before, take a look at the kit you already own and have a crack at your own multiroom streaming solution. </p><p><strong>With the right kit, you\'ll be watching and recording TV in no time </strong></p><p>We all like to sit back and relax with a good TV show. And thanks to your Mac and some special kit, you can take the experience to another level.</p><p><img alt=\"Playlists\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.playlists-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p> If watching, pausing and rewinding live TV on your Mac sounds good, you ain\'t heard nothing yet. You can get an electronic programme guide (EPG), record programmes, export them to iTunes to play on an iPhone, iPad or Apple TV, and control the setup from your portable Apple device. </p><p><strong>Elgato networked tuners </strong></p><p>An alternative to the USB tuners is one of Elgato\'s networked TV tuners, such as the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/tv-tuner-cards/elgato-eyetv-netstream-dtt-690847/review\">Netstream DTT</a> (£180). Connect it to your aerial, plug an Ethernet lead between it and your Wi-Fi router, and you\'ve got TV anywhere on your home network. </p><p>A benefit over USB, is you\'re not limited to where you watch TV in your house, as your Mac doesn\'t have to be tied to an aerial all the time. Another great thing about the Netstream DTT is that it\'s got a twin tuner, meaning two people can watch different channels simultaneously, or you can record one show while you enjoy another. </p><p>You need to think about where you\'re going to put the Netstream DTT, because it needs a direct connection to an aerial and your router. You\'ll also need an aerial splitter to enable you to leave your existing TV plugged in, since the Netstream DTT doesn\'t have a coax-out socket. </p><p>And with Elgato\'s £2.99 iOS app, you can connect to and control their TV tuners from anywhere using an iPhone, iPad or iPod touch, provided your Mac\'s running. </p><p><strong>Elgato USB tuners </strong></p><p>One of the big players in the Mac TV market is Elgato, which makes a range of tuners that plug into a free-to-air TV aerial and connect to one of your Mac\'s USB ports. There are also products for free-to-air satellite connections, but not for Sky or Virgin Media TV - to watch these services on your Mac, have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/sling-media-slingbox-pro-hd-908835/review\">Slingbox Pro HD</a>. </p><p>Elgato doesn\'t support UK Freeview HD either. To see a full list of the tuners Elgato offers, have a look at the <a href=\"http://www.elgato.com/elgato/int/mainmenu/products.en.html\">Elgato site</a>, but the one we particularly like is the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/tv-tuner-cards/elgato-eyetv-dtt-deluxe-457756/review\">EyeTV DTT Deluxe</a> (£70), because it\'s so small. </p><p>As well as a remote control, it comes with two small aerials, and depending on how strong the signal is in your area, these may be enough. If not, you\'ll need to connect a larger antenna, such as your rooftop one to it, so bear in mind you\'ll need to be sitting somewhere near an aerial socket. </p><p>Getting started with the EyeTV DTT Deluxe is straightforward - you install the gorgeous EyeTV software that comes with the tuner, update to the latest version if necessary, and then work through a step-by-step setup guide. This will help you install the tuner, search for channels and register for your free one-year subscription to the tvtv EPG service, which will give you full programme listings, provided your Mac\'s connected to the internet.</p><p> With everything installed, EyeTV will open automatically when it detects a tuner. You can then watch, pause, rewind and record live TV. Scheduling recordings is a breeze - have a look. </p><p><strong>How to record with EyeTV </strong></p><p><strong>01. Find your show </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.step01-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Click the red button to record instantly; it can even go back to the start of the current show. To schedule a recording, press Ctrl+p and select Program Guide. Browse to your show and click the little dot. If you try to record two shows at once, EyeTV will warn you. </p><p><strong>02. Schedule it </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.step02-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Click Schedules in the left column to see what shows you\'ve set up to record. To the right of each programme, you can set to export the video for iPod or iPad, or add it to an EyeTV playlist, which work just like your music lists in iTunes, appearing in the left-hand column. </p><p><strong>03. Record entire series </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.step03-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>So that you never miss an episode, you can schedule a whole series to record. In the Programs window, click the + and create a new Smart Guide. Set the search options to find your series and click Options. Tick the Record All Matches box. </p><p><strong>equinux </strong></p><p>A cheaper alternative to the Elgato USB tuners is the Equinux TubeStick (£40). This plugs into your Mac and aerial to provide live TV on your computer. </p><p><img alt=\"TubeStick\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.tubestick-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Once its software - The Tube - is installed, it detects the USB tuner and searches for channels. It requires activation, and to use it on a different Mac, you need to deactivate the first before it\'ll work on the second.</p><p> Unlike Elgato\'s EyeTV, it uses the Freeview EPG, so you\'ll see the same details as on your television. We\'re less keen on the EPG interface though, where you\'re initially shown a list of all the shows on now. To browse an individual station, you find one of its programmes in the list and click the channel name. </p><p>The Tube adds a social element to TV viewing, too, by incorporating a chat window, where you can message other equinux users who are watching the same programme. Again, you can pause and rewind live TV, while recording is as simple as clicking the dot next to a programme name. You can search for upcoming shows and select which you\'d like to record, or schedule a timed recording. </p><p>Your saved programmes appear in a simple Library view, from where you can view them or export for iPod, iPhone, AppleTV or iMovie. The LiveTV iOS app (£2.99) enables you to watch TV on your iPhone, provided The Tube is running on your Mac and both devices are on the same Wi-Fi network - though we found it slightly temperamental when it came to connecting the two. There\'s also TubeToGo (59p), which enables you to schedule recordings on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. </p><p>The programmes are saved online, but you\'ll need to set up some kind of storage first - either FTP, MobileMe or local web sharing. Again, your Mac needs to be on and The Tube must be running. </p><p><strong>Slingbox </strong></p><p>The Slingbox is a versatile bit of kit that harnesses your existing TV setup and makes it available over the internet, so you can connect to it from just about anywhere you can get online. </p><p>Rather than offering the recording and EPG services you get with Elgato, it harnesses what you\'ve got and enables you to control it remotely. So if there\'s a PVR under your TV, set it from your Mac. </p><p>Similarly, if you link a Freeview box to it, you\'ll be able to use its EPG. It\'ll even mean you can access your Sky or Virgin Media box from your Mac. The top-end Slingboxes have built-in Freeview tuners, so when you watch TV remotely, you won\'t affect what someone in the living room is watching. </p><p>However, if you watch something from your Sky or Virgin box on your Mac, anyone in the living room will see the same channel as you. The whole thing works in a web browser and there are three Slingboxes to choose from - the SOLO (£120), <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/sling-media-slingbox-pro-hd-908835/review\">Pro</a> (£160) and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/audio-visual/digital-tv-receivers/sling-media-slingbox-pro-hd-908835/review\">Pro HD</a> (£240), and only the top two have the built-in tuner. For more about the differences, see <a href=\"http://uk.slingbox.com/go/slingbox-prohd-help-me-choose\">the Slingbox site</a>. </p><p>Sling also sells the SlingLink TURBO (£60), which enables you to locate your Slingbox away from your router. </p><p><strong>1. Set up Home Sharing </strong></p><p>Although the Apple TV is mainly aimed at letting you rent and play movies that you\'ve bought from the iTunes Store, you can also play any iTunes content that is stored on computers on your home network. This includes TV programmes and movies you\'ve bought. </p><p>All you have to do is go to the Advanced menu in iTunes and enter your iTunes account details to set up Home Sharing on that computer. Then you can go to your Apple TV and select Settings > Computers and enter the same details. </p><p><strong>2. Watch non-iTunes movies and videos </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Convert videos\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.convert_vids_video_drive-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>You might have videos in formats other than the ones the Apple TV can play. If you have them stored in iTunes, you can select them then choose Advanced > Create iPad or Apple TV version to convert them to a playable format. </p><p>Alternatively, you can use a program such as <a href=\"http://handbrake.fr/\">Handbrake</a> to convert more or less any video format to Apple TV format much more quickly than you can using iTunes. </p><p><strong>3. Add metadata quickly and easily</strong></p><p><img alt=\"metadata\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.metadata_1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Your Apple TV will display information about your video content, such as cast and synopsis. You can enter this manually in iTunes, but it\'s easier to use a program such as <a href=\"http://www.kerstetter.net/index.php/projects/software/metax\">MetaX</a> or <a href=\"http://www.aroona.net/VideoDrive/Home.html\">VideoDrive</a>, which will look up details and enter them into iTunes. </p><p>Select batches of videos stored in iTunes and it\'ll add the info for the files. </p><p><strong>4. Watch TV programmes on your Apple TV </strong></p><p>The Apple TV doesn\'t record or receive television signals or catch-up services such as the iPlayer. </p><p>However, you can buy episodes of TV shows from the iTunes Store on your Mac, as well as buy one of the many TV tuners from <a href=\"http://www.elgato.com/\">Elgato</a> and <a href=\"http://www.miglia.com/\">Miglia</a> that let you record TV on your Mac, even in HD where available. You can then export your recordings into iTunes in an Apple TV-friendly format. </p><p><strong>5. Stream content from your iOS device to an Apple TV using AirPlay </strong></p><p>When you\'re on the same wireless network as an Apple TV, in any AirPlay-compatible app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch such as the iPod or YouTube apps, a new icon will appear right next to the fast-forward button. It looks like a square with a triangle at the bottom. Press this and it will enable you to play your music or videos on the Apple TV. You can also use AirPlay from within iTunes on any Mac. </p><p><strong>6. Display video playlists </strong></p><p>By default, the Apple TV won\'t display your computers\' playlists anywhere except in Music. However, if you go into Settings > Audio and Video, selecting All in Show Playlists will let you change this so that your movie and TV show playlists - both regular and smart - will show up as well.</p><p> You won\'t be able to change them on the Apple TV, but any changes in iTunes will be reflected on the Apple TV. </p><p><strong>7. Display your photos on the Apple TV </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Photo playlist\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.photos_1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Once you\'ve enabled Home Sharing, you can also display all your photos on the Apple TV. Go into iTunes and choose Choose Photos to Share… from the Advanced menu. You\'ll then be able to choose whether you want to share your iPhoto photos or photos stored in a folder on your hard drive. </p><p>It\'s worth creating albums specifically for the Apple TV to use, so that only the best (or least embarrassing) show up. </p><p><strong>8. Use your photos as a screensaver </strong></p><p>Once you\'ve chosen which photos you want to share, you can replace the built-in screensaver with one made from your photos. Go to Settings > Screen Saver then click Photos. As well as Flickr and MobileMe galleries, you\'ll be able to select a computer and pick which photos you want to use for the screensaver. There are also different styles of screensaver to pick from.</p><p> <strong>9. Easier searching with your YouTube account </strong></p><p>Accessing YouTube from the Apple TV is easy. However, the Apple TV remote and onscreen keyboard isn\'t the best way of searching for videos. You can save yourself a lot of time by using your Mac to find videos then saving them as favourites in your Google or YouTube account. </p><p>You\'ll then be able to access them immediately by logging in using the same account on your Apple TV. You\'ll also have access to your YouTube subscriptions as well. </p><p><strong>10. Fixing problems </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Restart\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20233/MAC233.main_feat.restart-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Although the Apple TV is very reliable, sometimes problems can occur. Running Software Update from the Settings menu may reveal a fix if the software is out of date and even give you new features. </p><p>However, if something more serious is happening, you can bring up a menu that will let you run diagnostics and restore it to its factory settings - hold down the Menu and down buttons on your remote control for a few seconds until it restarts.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/14886fc2/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/e1aa62e/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Ccomputing0Capple0Chow0Eto0Estream0Evideo0Efrom0Eyour0Emac0Eto0Eipad0E718740A0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Guide: How to stream video from your Mac to iPad</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Tutorial%3A+The+complete+guide+to+AirPlay&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fapple%2Fthe-complete-guide-to-airplay-947819%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Tutorial%3A+The+complete+guide+to+AirPlay&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fcomputing%2Fapple%2Fthe-complete-guide-to-airplay-947819%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/101091021934/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/14886fc2/kg/201-216-221/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/101091021934/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/14886fc2/kg/201-216-221/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/networking/~4/jNlLcPtU7NE\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/networking/~3/jNlLcPtU7NE/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/networking\n',29015,NULL,'2011-05-01 07:00:00'),(200,'Speed Week: Go faster: beyond Thunderbolt and USB 3.0','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/networking-and-wi-fi/images/lightpeak-200-200.jpg\" /><p><em>This article is brought to you in association with</em> <a href=\"http://lgoptimus2.t3.com\">LG Optimus 2X</a></p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/intel-thunderbolt-in-apple-macbook-pro-explained-931050\">Thunderbolt connections in new MacBook Pros</a> are impressive, but they could have been even better: Thunderbolt is Intel\'s Light Peak technology, which was supposed to use fibre-optic wiring. For now, though, it\'s plain old copper.</p><p><p>In the longer term, Light Peak will move to fibre-optics delivering speeds of up to 100Gbps (it\'s 10Gbps in its current incarnation), but that won\'t be for a good few years yet: even Intel reckons it\'ll be the end of the decade before such speeds are practical. So what will we be using to connect our kit in the next few years?</p><p>In the short term, it\'s a battle between <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/intel-thunderbolt-in-apple-macbook-pro-explained-931050\">Thunderbolt</a> and <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/computing/usb-3-everything-you-need-to-know-638185\">USB 3.0</a>, with Intel and Apple in the Thunderbolt corner and everyone else in the USB one. </p><p>At 5Gbps USB 3.0 is 10 times faster than its predecessor, and it\'s backwards compatible - so you can buy USB 3.0 kit now and use it with USB 2.0 connectors, although of course you\'ll only get 2.0 speeds. We could see the FireWire situation all over again, with Thunderbolt appearing in high-end kit and USB 3.0 in cheaper devices.</p><p><strong>Go wireless</strong></p><p>In the longer term, the idea of connecting things with cables will start to seem rather silly - or at least, it will if we can sort out the mess of competing standards. Cable-free connections already come in a bewildering array of options, including Wireless USB, WHDI, WirelessHD and WiGig.</p><p>Wireless USB uses ultra-wideband (UWB) radio for reasonably fast short-range connections: it can deliver up to 480Mbps over three metres and 110Mbps over 10. </p><p>It\'s not fast enough for long-range HD video streaming, but it\'s great for games controllers and relatively low-bandwidth connections such as those for printers or digital cameras. </p><p>Its key competitor is Bluetooth: 3.0 devices are already shipping, and the 4.0 spec promises lower energy consumption and improved range; like 3.0 the fastest Bluetooth 4.0 connections should achieve around 24Mbps.</p><p>That\'s fine for connecting peripherals, but what about HD video? There are three key forms of super-fast wireless: WHDI, WirelessHD and Wi-Gig.</p><p>WHDI is a kind of cross between HDMI and Wi-Fi. Designed specifically for streaming video, it uses the 5GHz frequency band (which is also used by 802.11n networks) and can support data rates of up to 3Gbps. </p><p>In theory the range is beyond 100 feet through walls, although as with any wireless tech that\'s probably optimistic. Supporters include Sony, LG, Hitachi, Samsung and Sharp, but that pales into comparison next to WirelessHD.</p><p>WirelessHD is another short-range wireless technology, but this one uses the 60GHz frequency band for HD video. With supporters including pretty much everybody in electronics - Intel, Broadcom, Dell and almost every consumer electronics firm - it\'s the one to watch, no pun intended.</p><p><strong>Connect more</strong></p><p>Connecting things to screens is all well and good, but what about connecting other things together? For that we\'ll probably use WiGig, which the Wi-Fi Alliance is considering for future Wi-Fi certification. </p><p>Like WirelessHD it uses the 60GHz frequency band (although it could drop down to use Wi-Fi bands if no WiGig kit is in range), but it\'s designed for networking rather than video streaming. </p><p>With speeds of up to 6Gbps, its short range - a couple of metres - means it\'s ideal for interconnecting kit without sharing your stuff with the whole street. </p><p>And Wi-Fi? That\'s getting faster, too. The next big standard is 802.11ac, which promises 1Gbps speeds using the same 5GHz frequency band as 802.11n. Certification should begin next year, although as with 802.11n we\'ll probably see \"pre-ac\" kit appearing in the shops before the standard is actually ratified.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/1406e889/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/10bde57e/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30Cfvk0Iw3zZHmE0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">In Depth: 20 OS X networking problems and fixes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/1108143a/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30Cmu0IoIvmz74M0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to build your own router</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/116d2cef/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30CZWJsx0AJxVx40Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to build the ultimate home media network</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/11dbb943/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30CnxKdQPdKQWM0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to share a printer using OS X</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/12fd6aaa/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Cpowerline0Enetworking0Ewhat0Eyou0Eneed0Eto0Eknow0E930A6910Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Explained: Powerline networking: what you need to know</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Speed+Week%3A+Go+faster%3A+beyond+Thunderbolt+and+USB+3.0&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fnetworking%2Fgo-faster-beyond-thunderbolt-and-usb-3-0-941470%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Speed+Week%3A+Go+faster%3A+beyond+Thunderbolt+and+USB+3.0&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fnetworking%2Fgo-faster-beyond-thunderbolt-and-usb-3-0-941470%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/98747933253/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/1406e889/kg/201-216-221/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/98747933253/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/1406e889/kg/201-216-221/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/networking/~4/91wJ8gXYSzU\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/networking/~3/91wJ8gXYSzU/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/networking\n',6868,NULL,'2011-04-18 09:45:00'),(201,'Fujitsu to bring 1Gbps broadband to 5m UK homes','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/networking-and-wi-fi/images/fibre_optic-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Fujitsu has announced that its plans to bring fibre optic next-gen internet to 5 million UK homes, with the communications giant working with Virgin Media, TalkTalk and Cisco. </p><p>The collaboration will see Fujitsu build what it is calling \"ground breaking and innovative alternative to BT Openreach\" </p><p>Virgin Media and TalkTalk will offer wholesale products via the network, and it will be opened out to other service providers. </p><p><strong>Improving lives</strong></p><p>Communication Minister Ed Vaizey said: \"Superfast broadband is already helping businesses grow and improving the lives of those able to access it.

File Sharing','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.mac-200-200.jpg\" /><p>You\'re sat in the lounge with your family, and you want to show them your holiday videos on the Mac mini you use as a media centre. But the videos are on your iMac. How do you transfer them? </p><p><p>Or maybe you\'ve just finished a Keynote presentation, and need to share it with a colleague who has his own user account on your Mac. It\'s too big to email, so how do you get it to him? </p><p>You could use a USB stick, or email smaller files to yourself. Or for your home network, you could invest in a network attached storage (NAS) drive, accessible to everyone. But there\'s another way. </p><p>Using OS X\'s file-sharing abilities, you can define a folder as \'shared\', enabling other computers on your network - and other user accounts on your Mac - to access them. Privileges can be set to give different access rights to different accounts, allowing people or groups to read, write or both.</p><p> Every OS X user account has a Public folder, which is used to share files with other people. It\'s always accessible to other user accounts on the same machine, and if File Sharing is enabled, it can be used to share files over a network too. </p><p>Your Public folder is found in Hard Drive/Users/[username]. Inside is another folder called Drop Box. By default, anyone connected to your Mac can read from (and copy files from) your Public folder, and write to (but not open) the Drop Box, though this can be configured if you wish. File Sharing also lets you define other folders as publicly accessible. </p><p>To activate and configure your Mac\'s File Sharing function, you must be logged on as an administrator, or at least know an administrator\'s username and password. Under the Apple menu, choose System Preferences. Open the Sharing pane - the one that looks like a folder with a figure in a yellow diamond on it. </p><p>If you\'re logged into an account that doesn\'t have administrator privileges, click on the lock in the bottom-left corner of the window, and enter the name and password of an administrator. If you\'re using an admin account, it should already be open.</p><p> <strong>File-sharing function </strong></p><p><img alt=\"share\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.main-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Click on the check box labelled File Sharing to enable this feature. Your public folder is now accessible to other users on the network, and can be accessed by clicking on your computer in the Shared column in a Finder window\'s side bar (if the side bar is missing, toggle it on or off by pressing the pill-shaped button in the top-right corner). </p><p>You can now make files accessible to others by moving or copying them to your Public folder, and they can give files to you by putting them in your Drop Box folder, which everyone can see, but only you can open. </p><p>Once again, these are default settings, and can be configured to behave differently, as we\'ll cover in more depth later. But what if you want to share other folders? </p><p>For example, to give everyone in your house access to your Movies folder, without moving it into your Public folder? To do this, we must define Movies (or indeed any folder) as \'shared\'. With File Sharing highlighted, two panels appear to the right, one titled Shared Folders and one called Users. Both have little boxes underneath labelled \'+\' and \'-\'. </p><p>To share a folder with everyone on your network, press the \'+\' button under the Shared Folders panel and navigate to the folder to share. To remove a folder from this list, highlight it and press the \'-\' button. </p><p><strong>The Users panel </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Users\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.5_B-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The Users panel allows you to set privileges for individuals and groups. In the Shared Folders panel, select the folder you wish to affect. The Users panel shows the access rights currently enjoyed by yourself and others. </p><p>By pressing the \'+\' button under the panel, you can add individual users and groups. Again, highlight and press \'-\' to remove them. </p><p>New user or group accounts can be created in the Accounts system preference, or you can set up a new user without creating a new account on your Mac by pressing the New Person button in the dialog window that appears when you press \'+\'. A password can also be set for this new person. </p><p>To add him or her to the Users panel, highlight his or her new account and press Select. By default, a new user or group added to the Users list has Read Only access. To change this, click on the words Read Only and select another option from the pull-down. </p><p>Read Only access means that a person or group can open that folder and take files, but cannot put anything in it or edit files that are already there. Write Only access is the exact opposite - the user can copy files into that folder for the account holder to use, but cannot open it or take anything from it. A person or group with Read & Write privileges has full access to that folder, and can open, edit or take files, copy data to the folder or delete items. </p><p>The group titled Everyone is a global setting, and can also be set to the self-explanatory No Access. Note that if a user account is set up for someone who\'s also a member of a group, personal settings override group restrictions. </p><p>For example, if Fred Smith is given Read & Write access, but he\'s included in a group that has Write Only privileges, Fred can Read & Write. </p><p>An alternative way of creating and managing shared folders exists, apart from System Preferences. In Finder, highlight the folder you want to share, and press Command+i or right-click and select Get Info. This brings up that folder\'s Info window. At the foot of the General section is a check box entitled Shared Folder. Checking this makes it shared (if you check it with File Sharing off, you\'re invited to activate this feature). </p><p>At the foot of the Info window, in a section labelled Sharing & Permissions, you can set read and write privileges. If you want to share with computers running Windows or Linux, you have to activate the necessary network protocols to allow your Mac to communicate with the operating system that needs to access your files.</p><p> In the Sharing preference pane, click on Options. Apple Filing Protocol (AFP) is active by default, and allows you to share with Macs. To share with Linux and Unix systems, check the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) box. You\'re given a server address for Linux/Unix users to access, or they can browse for your computer by name. To share with Windows users, check the Server Message Block (SMB) box. </p><p>Check the user accounts you wish to enable for SMB, and enter the password for that account. When you\'re ready, click Done to finish. </p><p><strong>MobileMe benefits </strong></p><p><img alt=\"pictures\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.cap1_B-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Of course, MobileMe subscribers have another option. MobileMe\'s iDisk feature gives you 20GB of cloud storage, and a couple of easy ways to share your files with others. By uploading a file to your iDisk\'s Public folder, it can be downloaded by anyone. </p><p>To upload a file to iDisk through Finder, select iDisk from a Finder window\'s side bar or click on Finder\'s Go pull-down menu, scroll down to iDisk and select My iDisk. If you\'re not already logged on in System Preferences, you have to enter your details when prompted. You can then transfer files to any of your iDisk folders (including Public) through the Finder. </p><p>Alternatively, upload from the MobileMe website. Go to www.me.com and log in to your account. Click on the cloud icon in the top-left corner, and switch to iDisk. Select the folder you wish to upload to, and press the up arrow in the blue bar at the top of the website. </p><p>Now, navigate to the file you want to upload. If you want to password-protect your iDisk\'s Public folder, in the iDisk section of www.me.com, click the cog icon in the top bar and select Preferences; here you can opt to set, change or remove a password. You can also edit permissions to write to or delete files from the Public folder. </p><p>To access another user\'s Public folder from your own Mac, in Finder\'s Go menu, select iDisk > Another User\'s Public Folder. Enter the MobileMe account name of the person whose Public folder you wish to access, and the password if necessary. You can now download files from that person\'s folder, and also upload and delete files, if they\'ve enabled this in their iDisk preferences. </p><p>Note that your iDisk\'s Public folder is stored on a cloud server as part of your MobileMe account\'s alloted storage space, and is not the same as your OS X account\'s Public folder. </p><p>If you want to give someone access to a specific file on your iDisk without putting it into the Public folder, you can invite them to download it by email. Log onto www.me.com/idisk, and navigate to the file you wish to share. Click on it, and then click on the Share File button in the right-hand column. </p><p>You\'re then given a URL at which the file can be downloaded. Enter the email address of the person you want to share it with and a message in the fields provided, and press Share; the URL is emailed, and the recipient can download the file just by clicking on the link. If you want to send the email from an account other than your me.com address, you can copy and paste the URL and leave the email and message fields blank. You still have to click on Share, though, or the file won\'t be shared and the link won\'t work. </p><p>Finally, MobileMe service Back to My Mac is an easy and convenient way of remotely accessing another Mac that\'s logged into the same account, from both your home network and over the internet. It\'s a great way of using your notebook to retrieve files from your home machine while out and about, but it must be switched on if you\'re to do it. </p><p><strong>How to activate and use OS X File Sharing</strong></p><p><strong> 1. System Preferences </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.1_B-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Open System Preferences from the Apple menu, and go into the Sharing preference pane, found in the Internet & Wireless section. It looks like a folder badged with a stick man on a yellow diamond. It\'s here that you activate File Sharing, and other sharing services. </p><p><strong>2. Switch File Sharing on </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.2_B-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Click the File Sharing check box to turn on File Sharing. You\'ll need to be an administrator, or know an admin\'s name and password. File Sharing is switched on, and a list of currently shared folders appears in the central panel. Each user account has its own shared Public folder. </p><p><strong>3. Add folder to share </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.3_B-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>To define another folder as shared, click the \'+\' button under the Shared Folders panel. Navigate to the folder you wish to share (such as Movies, as shown here) and click on Add. It appears in the Shared Folders panel. If you want to unshare a folder, highlight it and click \'-\'. </p><p><strong>4. Add users </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 4\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.4_B-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>You can add new users in the Users panel. Highlight the shared folder you wish to give access to, and click the \'+\' button under the panel. Choose a user or group that\'s already set up in the Accounts pane, or click New Person. </p><p><strong>5. Access Privileges </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 5\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.5_B-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Modify a user\'s access privileges via the pull-downs in the second column of the Users panel. Read & Write gives full access to a folder, Read Only lets them take files but not put any in, and Write Only lets them copy to, not from it. </p><p><strong>6. Use the Info Window </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 6\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20230/MAC230.tut_share.6_B-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Most of these functions can be accessed via a folder\'s Info window. Highlight the folder in question, press Command-i, or right-click and select Get Info. From this window, you can share and unshare the folder and modify permissions.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/1353ec72/mf.gif\" width=\"1\"

has been around long enough now for us to forget how amazing the idea was when the first HomePlug standard emerged in 2001. Imagine, you could use the power wires in your house as network cables, a fully-wired house in an instant! </p><p><p>The simplest use is to connect your broadband box of tricks hanging off your phone jack, which is often somewhere useful like the downstairs hall, to your PC, which is likely to be anywhere but the hallway. </p><p>The widespread adoption of wireless modems has reduced the impact somewhat, but for networking your house it\'s a neat and simple solution. You\'ve no problems with thick walls either: it\'ll run up to 300 metres and in theory you can add 254 devices (although more than 10 starts to slow things down). </p><p>Plus it all happens outside your PC (let\'s just say that the lack of Windows drivers is no bad thing). It\'s about as simple as networking gets. The technology goes under a lot of names, but we\'ll go with HomePlug. </p><p>Actually the basic idea is an old one: the power companies have been sending control signals over the mains since the 1920s - that\'s how electricity meters know to switch to the off-peak rate. And it\'s about much more than just networking computers and their peripherals: sending data over the power lines can be used to monitor and control everything connected to the mains. </p><p>Enter the internet fridge, and, we trust, more useful appliances. </p><p><strong>The same, only faster </strong></p><p>So why are we here again? New faster standards, that\'s why! The original HomePlug 1.0 standard accelerated out of the blocks at a somewhat pedestrian 14Mb/s, peaking at 85Mb/s a few releases down the line.</p><p> This was followed in 2005 by HomePlug AV, which could manage a peak rate of 200Mb/s and traded on the ability to cope with video and voice, hence \'AV\'. The Technical Working Group of the HomePlug Alliance (both are just what they sound like they are) has now rustled up the HomePlug AV2 standard, which it claims \"is expected to deliver a five times increase in performance\". Big talk, as that\'ll be 600 Mb/s. </p><p>AV2 is fully interoperable with the older HomePlug AV standards and two other new formats: Green PHY and IEEE P1901. The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers is the world\'s largest professional association dedicated to advancing technological innovation and excellence for the benefit of humanity (that\'s what it humbly says about itself anyway). These are the people behind the 802.3 Ethernet and 802.11 Wireless standards and they\'ve outlined the P1901 standard, which offers 500Mb/s. </p><p>P1901 is based on HomePlug AV and is in the final stage of certification. There\'s also Green PHY, or HomePlug GP, which isn\'t aimed at PCs as such - it\'s a sort of green thing for the remote control of devices and part of the Smart Grid idea. It\'s basically a trimmed-down, low-bandwidth and low-power version of HomePlug, enabling you to monitor and turn things on and off remotely and whatnot. </p><p>Eventually you\'ll be able to sit on the sofa and control all the electrical devices in the house. But is the emergence of two new higher-speed standards a problem? </p><p>Not at all: they will work with each other and P1901 is really just another layer of standardisation and ratification for HomePlug, a base standard to work from. If things go to plan, just about all the versions should talk to each other and you\'ll be able to mix and match, buying on price and performance rather than being tied to any one standard (backward compatibility for version 1.0 aside - that\'s technically possible, but economically unfeasible). </p><p>This is important for the whole industry, so we\'re sure they won\'t muck it all up by splitting the market. We don\'t want any more incompatibilities such as that between the 200Mb/s NetGear and Devolo kit. Right, guys? </p><p><strong>Real-world speeds </strong></p><p>HomePlug AV2\'s top speed of 600Mb/s is a theoretical maximum of course. Add encryption, fluctuations in the mains, interference, distance, various overheads and so forth and well, we shall see. </p><p>The 200Mb/s AV version returns about 190Mb/s under ideal conditions in a simple speed test across about 10 feet. In the real world this\'ll mean it\'ll be more like 150Mb/s or so, dropping to under 100Mb/s if you really push the parameters. We won\'t get 600Mb/s, sigh. </p><p>We should easily see over 400Mb/s or so though, which is fast enough for lots of HD video, which is what everybody seems to insist on pushing across links now. It\'s no Gigabit LAN, sure, but it has to do much more work in a hostile environment. </p><p>Sounds great, but there\'s a good reason why everybody doesn\'t use HomePlug: it\'s not cheap. A basic two plug starter system goes for around £50 for version 1.0 and £80-odd for HomePlug AV. Adding another device adds another £25 or more. </p><p>When you start to explore what\'s going on inside a HomePlug unit, it becomes clear why they cost what they do: there\'s some serious electrical trickery involved. A lot of the current kit is beautifully built: Devolo in particular knows how to produce good looking, family friendly kit. </p><p>We recently tested its <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/general-networking/devolo-dlan-200-av-wireless-n-starter-kit-926326/review\">dLAN 200 AVSmart+ Starter Kit</a> and were most impressed - it was built like a tank. The other big player is Netgear: its kit isn\'t quite as accomplished, but it\'s cheaper. Then there are Belkin, Cisco, Sharp and a few other big names: not a lengthy list yet, but growing.</p><p><img alt=\"music streaming\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Format/PCF%20249/PCF249.w_tech.collage-280-100.jpg\" width=\"280\" /></p><p><strong>MULTI-ROOM AUDIO:</strong> <em>The Collage system from Russound features natty remote controls with which you can access all areas</em></p><p> HomePlug isn\'t the only network you\'ll need. Wireless is still, well, wireless, and if you want the fastest possible connection then using a Ethernet cable is still the way to go, and always will be; you can\'t beat a direct wired connection. But the idea has grown from a curious approach to a solid standard for houses that aren\'t fully-cabled expensive new builds. </p><p>There\'s also the technology to go the whole hog and use the mains to deliver your broadband too, no phone socket required. With Broadband over Power Lines (BPL), your modem can be plugged into any socket in the house. This one does require a spot of infrastructure investment in mains wiring, though - repeaters and filters and whatnot. It\'s currently one of those \'It\'s technically possible, should we give it a proper go commercially?\' ideas that are currently floating around. </p><p>You\'ll be seeing a lot more of HomePlug and similar technologies in the future. Electrical devices are going to start talking to each other through the power lines - a network of wires that makes the internet look meagre in comparison. </p><p>Computers started life in isolation. Networking and then the internet brought a whole new dimension. Now every electrical device you plug into the wall can join in. Hyperbole? Yes, but you get the picture. </p><p>Meanwhile, HomePlug is a very workable and neat system. At the moment it\'s expensive, but it will soon get fast enough to be very interesting. What we need now is volume to lower the cost of the kit.</p></p><strong>Related Links</strong><ul><li><a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/network-adapters\">Read more network adapter reviews</a></li></ul><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/12fd6aaa/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/10bde57e/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30Cfvk0Iw3zZHmE0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">In Depth: 20 OS X networking problems and fixes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/1108143a/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30Cmu0IoIvmz74M0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to build your own router</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/116d2cef/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30CZWJsx0AJxVx40Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to build the ultimate home media network</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/11dbb943/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30CnxKdQPdKQWM0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">Tutorial: How to share a printer using OS X</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/1406e889/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Cgo0Efaster0Ebeyond0Ethunderbolt0Eand0Eusb0E30E0A0E941470A0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Speed Week: Go faster: beyond Thunderbolt and USB 3.0</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Explained%3A+Powerline+networking%3A+what+you+need+to+know&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fnetworking%2Fpowerline-networking-what-you-need-to-know-930691%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Explained%3A+Powerline+networking%3A+what+you+need+to+know&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Fnetworking%2Fpowerline-networking-what-you-need-to-know-930691%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/96270123849/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/12fd6aaa/kg/25-38-40-43-44-65-68-143-170-201-216/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/96270123849/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/12fd6aaa/kg/25-38-40-43-44-65-68-143-170-201-216/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/networking/~4/w-iTYgrJWpk\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/networking/~3/w-iTYgrJWpk/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/networking\n',10380,NULL,'2011-02-26 10:00:00'),(206,'Gary Marshall: Is the future of search social?','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/internet-and-broadband/google/google-socialsearch-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Fresh from helping us <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/google-search-is-broken-928718\">block content farms from search results</a>, Google has a new wheeze: more <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/news/internet/google-adds-deeper-twitter-integration-to-search-929370\">social search</a>. Now, when you search the web you can bring your friends with you.</p><p>Don\'t worry. Your friends won\'t be virtually watching over your shoulder as you search for naked midgets covered in coleslaw or ask Dr Google about unpleasantness in your unmentionables. </p><p>Rather, Google will refine search results based on what your friends have shared online. It\'s offered a social element for a while, but it\'s more useful now and more prominent.</p><p>It\'s a clever idea. When I\'m thinking about booking a holiday, my friends\' recommendations of kid-friendly resorts mean more to me than any brochure\'s blurb or travel site\'s summary - and my friends\' photos of cockroaches the size of dogs can help me avoid the holiday from hell.</p><p>Leaving aside the obvious privacy implications - it doesn\'t work if you don\'t give Google access to your social links, so it\'s yet more information the firm\'s storing about you - and the fact Facebook isn\'t included because it and Google are still having a fight, I can only think of one teeny-weeny little problem.</p><p>My social graph is too squiggly.</p><p><strong>Social not working</strong></p><p>The problem I have with social networks is I\'m too nice. I don\'t want to offend anyone. So when I get a friend request from somebody I last spoke to 22 years ago, and whose only real connection with me is that I really fancied their sister, I don\'t want to dismiss them; I find it\'s more polite to accept the request than to ignore it or refuse it. If someone I\'ve contacted through work pops up with request, I\'ll add them too.</p><p>Bring Twitter into the equation and things get even more complex. I follow a few hundred people who are interesting in various ways. But just because I care what they think about, say, Nokia or HTML5 or Ford Mondeos doesn\'t mean I give a hoot about their taste in music, their favourite kind of jumper or their opinions on Israel. Quite the contrary: I often find people I follow posting links to things that are variously idiotic, annoying or occasionally, downright frightening.</p><p>It\'s not Google\'s problem so much as social networking\'s problem: we connect to people in different ways for different reasons, and social networks aren\'t very good at differentiating between, say, your soulmate and someone you only know because the two of you went to the same U2 gig in 1992.</p><p>How does Google know which one\'s which?</p><p>Solving that problem won\'t be easy, but maybe it doesn\'t need to be solved.</p><p>Rather than using my social graph to refine my Google searches, I\'d prefer to use a social search engine that can find things across the various social networks I use. That\'s exactly what <a href=\"http://www.greplin.com\">Greplin</a> offers - and it does it really, really well. Google\'s asking the right questions, but I suspect Greplin is the one with the answers.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/12ce22cb/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/11a2584b/l/0Lfeedproxy0Bgoogle0N0C0Vr0Ctechradar0Cnetworking0C0V30CF0E0AqJfNPc6w0Cstory0A10Bhtm/story01.htm\">TalkTalk offering faster broadband \'boost\'</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/1207a0de/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cinternet0Cvirgin0Emedia0Erolls0Eout0E10A0Ambps0Eto0E150Ak0Emore0Ehomes0E923560A0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Virgin Media rolls out 100Mbps to 150k more homes</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/126fbbbf/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cinternet0Cbt0Eresults0Eshow0Egrowth0Ein0Edsl0Euptake0E9257980Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">BT results show growth in DSL uptake</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/133cd291/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cinternet0Cbt0Edeletes0Efair0Eusage0Epolicy0Econtrols0Efor0Ebroadband0E9344310Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">BT deletes fair usage policy controls for broadband</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/142b6aea/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cinternet0Cfujitsu0Eto0Ebring0E1gbps0Ebroadband0Eto0E5m0Euk0Ehomes0E942810A0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Fujitsu to bring 1Gbps broadband to 5m UK homes</a></li></ul></div><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table border=\"0\"><tr><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/sendemail2.html?title=Gary+Marshall%3A+Is+the+future+of+search+social%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Finternet%2Fis-the-future-of-search-social--929530%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/emailthis2.gif\" /></a></td><td valign=\"middle\"><a href=\"http://res.feedsportal.com/viral/bookmark.cfm?title=Gary+Marshall%3A+Is+the+future+of+search+social%3F&amp;link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.techradar.com%2Fnews%2Finternet%2Fis-the-future-of-search-social--929530%3Fsrc%3Drss%26attr%3Dnewsnetwor\" target=\"_blank\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://res3.feedsportal.com/images/bookmark.gif\" /></a></td></tr></table></div><br /><br /><a href=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/94604131556/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/12ce22cb/kg/25-40-42-45-65-68-93-160-216/a2.htm\"><img border=\"0\" src=\"http://da.feedsportal.com/r/94604131556/u/49/f/415082/c/669/s/12ce22cb/kg/25-40-42-45-65-68-93-160-216/a2.img\" /></a><img height=\"1\" src=\"http://feeds.feedburner.com/~r/techradar/networking/~4/2Yj3tjpA8wo\" width=\"1\" />','http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/techradar/networking/~3/2Yj3tjpA8wo/story01.htm','http://www.techradar.com/rss/news/networking\n',5922,NULL,'2011-02-18 12:30:00'),(207,'BT results show growth in DSL uptake','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/internet-and-broadband/images/bt-hq-200-200.jpg\" /><p>BT has announced its latest financial results – and pointed to a significant uptake in broadband internet as a key reason for profits and cash flow that were up year on year. </p><p>Revenue dropped for BT, a company that is investing heavily in fibre optic cabling in order to cope with the growing desire for superfast broadband. </p><p>But it was DSL growth that was picked out by the company – with BT adding 188,000 net additions, its most in eight years, and claiming a 53 per cent market share. </p><p><strong>Ahead YOY</strong></p><p>\"Profits and cash flow in the quarter were ahead of last year,\" said chief executive Ian Livingstone. </p><p>\"BT Retail had a good quarter with growth in business revenues and our highest share of DSL broadband net additions for eight years. </p><p>\"Openreach benefited from a stronger broadband market and growth in its copper line base. </p><p>\"BT Global Services is now expected to be cash flow positive this year, a year earlier than targeted. </p><p>\"These results show that we are making progress on a number of fronts.

to share a printer using OS X','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20229/MAC229.tut_print3.printing1_1-200-200.jpg\" /><p>For all the talk of a paperless office, there are times when you need a physical copy of something – be it an airline boarding pass, a letter to sign or just a photo for the mantelpiece. </p><p><p>Getting the document from your device to your printer is often tricky if your printer\'s in one room and the Mac you\'re working on is in another. But sharing a printer on your home network is really easy – and if you\'ve got a MacBook with Wi-Fi enabled it means you can print from as far as your wireless network reaches. </p><p>We\'ve put together this tutorial to look at a range of ways you can do it. Some of these methods will use kit you\'ve probably already got, such as a USB printer and a wired or wireless router. But we won\'t stop there, because there are plenty of other ways in which you can share a printer on your network. </p><p>Throughout this tutorial, we\'ll be talking about the Print & Fax pane a lot – you\'ll find it in System Preferences, accessed via the Apple menu. And to avoid repeating ourselves as we go through, you need to make sure you install the driver software that came with your printer on each of the Macs you want to print from. Do this by putting the CD that came with your printer into your Mac\'s drive, or by downloading the latest version for your model from the manufacturer\'s website.</p><p> Remember also that once you share a printer on your network, it\'ll be available to PCs as well, so if you have an unconverted friend or relative visiting, they should be able to access it from their notebook. </p><p>First off, let\'s look at the simplest method of sharing a USB printer. This involves hooking it up to one computer (the host) and sharing it so that other machines on the network can print to it, provided the host Mac is switched on. </p><p>First, open the Print & Fax pane on the host Mac and, if the printer isn\'t already listed, click +. In the window that appears, you\'ll see it listed under Default. Below, give it a recognisable name, which could be anything from the make and model to \'My colour printer\'. Use the Location field to let people know where it is – such as \'Downstairs study\'. Then click Add. </p><p><strong>Printer alert </strong></p><p>If the printer is already in the list and you want to alter the Name and Location information, just click Options & Supplies. Once you\'re happy, tick the box marked Share this printer on the network. You may then see an alert that Printer Sharing is disabled.</p><p> In any case, click Sharing Preferences… and make sure the box next to Printer Sharing in the left column is checked. Your printer will appear ticked in the middle box – if you have more than one, you can pick and choose which to share. </p><p>If you have Snow Leopard, you\'ll see another box on the right. Use it to select who can and can\'t print to each printer. In most cases, such as your home network, you\'ll be fine leaving this set to Everyone, but you can add specific users if you prefer – just click + and add who you\'d like to be able to print – it\'s best to give them the exact names they use to log into their Macs. Give each person a password that they\'ll have to type in to print. </p><p>All you need to do then is to add the printer on each computer you want to print from. Go into the Print & Fax pane and click +. Your shared printer should appear under the Default tab, showing the name and location you gave it. Click Add and you\'re ready to print. </p><p><strong>Off on a print job </strong></p><p>The downside to this method of sharing is that you need to have the host machine switched on (but not necessarily logged in) for the printer to kick into action. If the host Mac\'s switched off, the print job will remain on your local Mac until both are switched on simultaneously, at which point your document will hop across and roll off the press. </p><p>So while this setup is simple to configure and almost certainly doesn\'t require you to buy extra hardware, it\'s not the most convenient way to go about things. Having to go and switch on your host Mac, wait for it to start up, let the file print and then shut it down again, makes this less appealing. </p><p>So let\'s look at some other ways to share a printer. The first alternative is to hook your printer up to your broadband router directly, so that it\'s not dependent on a particular Mac being switched on. Some printers, primarily those aimed at small or home offices, will have an Ethernet port, which makes plugging them into any router straightforward. </p><p>For this system to work as efficiently as possible, remember to leave your router and printer switched on all the time, so that you can always print at the click of a button. </p><p>Setup will vary between printer models, and with some it\'ll just be a case of plug and play, especially if your router\'s set up as a DHCP server and you\'ve got the printer drivers installed on your Mac. Simply click + in the Print & Fax pane and the printer should be listed under Default. </p><p>If it isn\'t, you may need to configure it manually using the IP Printing tab. This will probably involve looking up your printer\'s IP address, which you can do via its built-in display, and most models will print you out a sheet containing all the vital network details. For more information on setting this up, have a look at your printer\'s documentation. </p><p>We\'ve always found an Ethernet link to be one of the easiest methods to set up and most robust in use, so if your printer and router have both USB and Ethernet ports, use the latter. </p><p><strong>Networking USB printers </strong></p><p>If your printer doesn\'t have an Ethernet socket, there are now many routers and network-attached storage (NAS) boxes with USB ports on them, to which you can connect a printer. </p><p>Apple\'s AirPort Extreme or Time Capsule both offer this functionality. These models even enable you to connect more than one device to their single USB port, using a hub. This means you needn\'t give up the hard drive you use for Time Machine backups in favour of a printer, for example. </p><p>It\'s worth noting, however, that not all router USB ports support printing, so check that your model does before plugging your printer into it (or going to the effort of investing in a new one). When it comes to setting this up, some routers may do all the donkey-work for you and the printer will appear in the Default area of the Print & Fax Add Printer window. </p><p>Have a look at the walkthrough below, where we take you through setting up and sharing a USB printer with a Time Capsule. </p><p>Third-party routers may not be so helpful, and could require you to use their web interface to enable the printer, and with others you may have to add the printer using the IP Printing tab in the Print & Fax Add Printer window. Depending on your router model, getting this to work can take quite a bit of fiddling around with settings and emails to the support team, but check the documentation that came with it first; it should give you step-by-step instructions on how to connect a USB printer so that anyone on the network can use it. </p><p>One device that saw everything working smoothly, was a new high-end Belkin router, which comes with software you install on each Mac. This guides you through the few steps required to print to a printer hooked up to the router\'s USB port. </p><p>If your printer\'s ever been linked directly to any of the Macs on your network, make sure you remove its entry from the Print & Fax pane on every machine before you connect it to your router and attempt to set it up. If you don\'t, its presence could cause conflicts when you try to print to it via the router. To remove it, select its old entry in the Print & Fax pane and click the – button. </p><p>One device we haven\'t mentioned yet is the AirPort Express. This is Apple\'s wireless printing and audio box, which, at under £90, is an affordable way to network your USB printer if you don\'t have a router with USB. </p><p>It links up to your existing network – wired or wirelessly – and enables you to share a USB printer. Switch on the printer and make sure the AirPort Express is connected to your network. Then all you need to do is open up the Print & Fax pane and click +. The printer should appear in the Default tab, so just click Add and you\'re ready to print.</p><p> If you want to share several printers in different locations, you can plug each one into an AirPort Express. </p><p><strong>Wireless printers </strong></p><p>Some printers will now do away with wires and enable you to print over Wi-Fi. This is an incredibly easy way of doing things, and in some cases doesn\'t even require you to have a router – but in our experience, it\'s easier if you do use one.</p><p> To set this up, make sure your Mac\'s connected to the router, either over Wi-Fi or via Ethernet. Then switch on the printer and connect it to your Wi-Fi router – the documentation that came with the printer will show you how to do this. </p><p>Once it\'s connected, open up your Print & Fax pane and click +. The Wi-Fi printer should appear under the Default tab. Click its name and your Mac should detect its driver on the Print Using drop-down. </p><p>In the Name field, you can give it a memorable title and enter a location for it, such as \'Study\'. Then click Add, and your Mac will spend a moment connecting to the printer, after which you\'ll be returned to the Print & Fax dialog, with your newly added printer visible. You can now print to this from your Mac. </p><p>Again, remember to leave the router and printer switched on for this setup to work efficiently – some printers prefer their sleep mode. </p><p><strong>How to share a USB printer via Time Capsule </strong></p><p><strong>01. Get started </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20229/MAC229.tut_print3.step01-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Install the printer driver and Time Capsule software on your Mac, then connect the latter to the mains. In Applications/Utilities, open Airport Utility and select the device, then go through the steps to set it up. Let the device restart, then quit Airport Utility.</p><p> <strong>02. Connect printer </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20229/MAC229.tut_print3.step02-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Go into the Print & Fax pane and make sure the printer you\'re about to connect isn\'t listed there. If it is, click the – button. Then, hook it up to the Time Capsule\'s USB port, switch it on and re-open AirPort Utility. Right-click your device and choose Manual Setup. </p><p><strong>03. Manual setup </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20229/MAC229.tut_print3.step03-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Type the router password if prompted and you\'ll be taken to the main configuration screen. Click Printers along the top and you should see yours listed on the right-hand side. If you don\'t, make sure the printer\'s switched on and connected, quit and re-open AirPort Utility. </p><p><strong>04. Change its name </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 4\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20229/MAC229.tut_print3.step04-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Your printer will appear on the network under the name you can see here. Depending on the model and driver, this may not be the most memorable or appropriate moniker, so you can change it to anything you like, simply by selecting it and clicking Edit. Then click Update. </p><p><strong>05. Further sharing </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 5\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20229/MAC229.tut_print3.step05-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If the Time Capsule is your main or only Wi-Fi router, skip to Step 6, but if you\'re using it in addition to the router your ISP supplied, you\'ll need to enable the Share printers over WAN option. This will ensure devices on your main network can use the shared printer. Click Update.</p><p> <strong>06. Ready to print </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 6\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20229/MAC229.tut_print3.step06-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Your printer\'s now ready to print to from any computers on your network, regardless of whether they\'re connected over AirPort or Ethernet. Just go into the Print & Fax pane, click + and you should see it under Default as a Bonjour printer. Select it and click Add.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/11dbb943/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related

want faster broadband – obviously. </p><p>\"The Boost will also help users share videos and photos with friends more quickly, and will allow the whole family to be online at the same time on different devices, without slowing the connection down,\" adds TalkTalk. </p><p>It\'s a product of the company\'s fibre optic roll-out, as TalkTalk looks to improve its infrastructure. </p><p>\"Customers wishing to see when Fibre Optic broadband will be available in their area should visit <a href=\"http://www.talktalk.co.uk/fibre\" title=\"blocked::http://www.talktalk.co.uk/fibre\">www.talktalk.co.uk/fibre</a> and enter their postcode and phone number,\" adds TalkTalk. </p><p><strong>An Engineer calls</strong></p><p>People who want \'THE BOOST\' (our capitals) can contact TalkTalk and get an engineer sent round to install a new modem and router and makes sure everything is working. </p><p>Tristia Clarke, commercial director at TalkTalk, said: \"We are seeing increasing demand for superfast broadband and our Fibre Optic Boost is a great way to ensure seamless connectivity and high upload and download speeds. </p><p>\"This boost is ideal for a wide range of customers, such as families who all want to be online at the same time, people wanting to stream HD content, or gamers needing lightning quick response times. </p><p>\"The installation process is straight forward as an engineer will make a home visit to get the connection up and running. </p><p>\"We expect this boost to be very popular and will be aiming to make it available to as many people as possible.\"</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/11a2584b/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div

They get damaged, they get lost, they won\'t work with all your equipment and they need a player in every room. </p><p>For a long time, moving a whole media collection onto a central server has been the dream of many. But potential problems, including the inevitable mess of cables, complex switch configuration and living with a noisy PC next to the telly, have put some people off. </p><p>Forget all that negativity. It\'s now possible to build a discreet, powerful system that will neither cost the Earth, nor need your family\'s approval for cable tethering. Best of all, you won\'t need to make compromises for quality. </p><p>Networks and hardware are now easily capable of streaming high-definition 1080p content. You probably already have the streaming client sitting underneath your television, or in the palm of your hand. Whether that\'s a PlayStation 3, a Nintendo Wii, an Android phone or an iPhone, linking all these devices together to create a home mesh of media is a great solution for people with large media collections – or children with sticky fingers. </p><p>If you\'re after the perfect living room experience, you can now buy devices that will grab data from numerous sources and push it through an HDMI cable straight to your television. The trick is knowing what goes where. </p><p>We\'re going to move from room to room, building the perfect solution for your home. We\'ll travel from the study, with its loading bay PC, to the modem and router in the hall, past the stairs with their hidden NAS box and on to the living room, where you\'ll be able to enjoy the fruits of all your hard work: lag- and stutter-free access to your entire media collection from the comfort of your sofa. </p><p><strong>The study </strong></p><p><strong>Welcome to the content generating control room </strong></p><p><img alt=\"study\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20303/TV%20network/PCP303.feat1.study_final-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>This is where your content metamorphoses from a physical liability into a series of files sitting on a network-attached storage box hidden under the stairs. This transformation must happen within a PC, because it involves a lot of number crunching to sort everything out neatly. </p><p>Whether you\'re turning an audio CD into MP3 and FLAC files, or transcoding a home movie into high-definition MKV, the more raw processing power you have, the less time you\'ll need to spend acting as disc-tray nanny. </p><p><strong>Central powerhouse <br /></strong></p><p>As a result, the study needs to house an all-powerful computer. It\'s going to run Windows 7, and it will need to be as brawny and power-efficient as possible, switching into a low-power standby mode when not in use and enabling network devices to have the on-demand option of using it for transcoding one video format to another, if the need arises. </p><p>The CPU needs to be of the full-fat variety, with as many cores as you can reasonably afford. AMD processors are currently top of the pile when it comes to price and performance, but we\'ve found that Intel CPUs are generally better behaved, suspend easier and use less power. </p><p>For that reason, we\'d recommend opting for a Core i7 model with as much speed and as many cores as you can happily pay for. <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/processors/intel-core-i7-875k-704393/review\">The Core i7-875k</a> is a good choice in this instance, because it balances this performance with relatively decent value now that its price has dipped below £300. </p><p>You\'ll need to combine this with plenty of memory, because video compression and transcoding will eat as much as you can throw at them. Consider 4GB of fast RAM as an absolute minimum. </p><p>If you\'re intending to record live television, you\'ll also need room for the Freeview card and plenty of hard drive space – although your NAS is going to be the archive for your data, so space on the PC is only going to be needed temporarily. </p><p><strong>GPU processing </strong></p><p>You might think you can skip the expensive 3D graphics card in favour of a machine that\'s meant only for 2D video, but there\'s an interesting technology that might make you reconsider. </p><p>The GPU within a 3D graphics card is itself a powerful number cruncher, and manufacturers are just starting to catch on to the idea that a GPU can be harnessed for desktop applications as well as gaming. </p><p>Nvidia, for example, has created a technology called CUDA, which will enable developers to use the power of your GPU to accelerate mathematically intensive processes – which is exactly what video encoding is. </p><p>Nero\'s Move It software encoder can use CUDA for video conversion, and Daniusoft\'s DVD Ripper claims that CUDA helps it attain a 500 per cent conversion speed. For this reason, it\'s worth trading some of your CPU budget for a decent Nvidia card. </p><p>The <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/pc-components/graphics-cards/evga-geforce-gtx-460-768mb-702153/review\">EVGA GeForce GTX 460</a>, at less than £150, is an excellent choice for GPU acceleration. </p><p>To complete the PC, you\'ll need decent networking provision. Your PC is going to be both the encoder and the transcoder, constantly shuttling data across the network, so the only realistic options for connectivity are physical – either with an Ethernet cable between this machine and the router, or a Powerline unit to pass the Ethernet through your home\'s power grid. </p><p>Wireless is fast enough in theory, but not in practice – especially when slower devices are also connected or other people are consuming the bandwidth. We recommend a wired Powerline backbone for data streaming, and because nearly all motherboards include Gigabit Ethernet, this is all you\'re going to need here. </p><p><strong>Software </strong></p><p>Finally, with the system configured and Windows 7 installed, you\'ll need some software to perform the transcoding magic. This will help platforms such as Nintendo\'s Wii and Apple\'s iPad access your entire media collection without the media being encoded into the formats those devices specifically support. </p><p>The best we\'ve found is <a href=\"http://tversity.com/\">TVersity</a>, which can cater for a vast number of players and understand almost any media format you throw at it. The basic version is free, and it\'s easily installed, automatically detecting all your media files stored locally. For remote files held on your NAS, you\'ll need to mount the remotely shared folder onto your system and make sure this mount point is connected each time your computer boots. </p><p><img alt=\"TVersity\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20303/TV%20network/PCP303.feat1.tversity_main-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you want to access your media collection from the internet, try downloading <a href=\"http://www.orb.com/\">Orb</a>. This uses a web portal to stream your media from your PC to any compatible and connected device on the web – the only limit being the upload speed of your home connection. </p><p><strong>The hallway</strong></p><p><strong>The hub for wireless and internet access</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Hallway\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20303/TV%20network/PCP303.feat1.hallway_01-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Most modern houses have their master telephone socket located in the hall. If you use ADSL for broadband, connecting your modem to this socket is going to give you the best performance. This is because there\'s likely to be less interference from other devices using the same phone line, such as phones, satellite receivers and alarms. </p><p>However, it also creates a problem, because the hall is usually the least accommodating room for storing networking equipment. For this reason, your router and modem need to be as discreet as possible, while still remaining powerful enough to act as your home\'s portal to the internet. </p><p><strong>Router choices </strong></p><p>The standard router, as provided by your ISP, is unlikely to offer the best potential performance or configurability. For faster ADSL connections, you\'ll need a router with a modem that\'s capable of negotiating the Annex M protocol. This is an extension to the standard ADSL2+ protocol that adds faster upload speeds and better stability. </p><p>It\'s a similar issue with wireless, where the 801.11n standard is now commonplace and interoperable. If range is important, you may want to consider a dual-band device. We\'d also recommend keeping your media streaming off the wireless network, and using wireless only for laptops, netbooks and portable devices. You should then use either a physical Ethernet connection or a Powerline connection for the media delivery. </p><p>Setting up the system should then be as simple as connecting your router to the phone line through an ADSL filer, setting it up through the web interface and moving on to another room. </p><p>If you use an internet phone service such as Skype or you\'re a keen online gamer, you\'ll need a router that will let you configure Quality of Service for specific protocols. This will boost their priority over other connections when they\'re in use. </p><p>There are hundreds of different routers to choose from, but if you\'re having difficulty, a recent survey on the Be Unlimited forum – a meeting place for fairly exacting web users – revealed that 55 per cent would plump for a Netgear router, with the <a href=\"http://www.techradar.com/reviews/pc-mac/networking-and-wi-fi/modem-routers/netgear-dg834n-30828/review\">Netgear DG834N</a> (at around £80) being a particularly popular choice. </p><p>If you\'re in any doubt as to which device will perform best with your ISP, the user forum is usually the best place to start your research. </p><p><strong>Under the stairs </strong></p><p><strong>Store your media library safely and securely </strong></p><p><img alt=\"Under stairs\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20303/TV%20network/PCP303.feat1.understairs-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>With a basic NAS, your files will simply be made available on the network – usually through Microsoft\'s Windows networking protocol. This will work fine for laptops, netbooks and certain set-top-boxes, but it isn\'t the easiest method to configure or set up. </p><p>The most common alternative is to find a NAS that supports the combination of DNLA and UPnP AV, which is a relatively painless way of streaming media to your various playback devices. You should aim for a NAS with 512MB of RAM and 1GHz CPU for maximum streaming capability. </p><p>UPnP AV is the most important part, because this is the protocol used to transport the data, while DNLA is the certification that guarantees certain capabilities. When all your devices talk together using UPnP and DNLA, you should be able to see your photos, music and movies without any further configuration, although you\'ll still need to give the formats some thought. </p><p>A PlayStation 3, for example, can make sense of MP3 music, display JPG image files, and play certain MP4, MPEG-2, AVI and DivX movies through DNLA. </p><p>Although the specification allows for one format to be converted to another, few NAS boxes are powerful enough to do this in real time as you\'re listening or watching. </p><p><strong>Compatible storage </strong></p><p>After media streaming comes storage. Most NAS boxes have a compatibility list, which you should check before committing to a purchase. Two terabytes are likely to be enough for most people, and with the average HD movie taking between 6-10GB of space, that\'s at least 100 movies before you have to worry about an upgrade. </p><p>You should also choose a drive that\'s quiet, efficient and powers down when not in use. If you\'ve got the money to hand, an enterprise-class drive is better suited to an always-on environment, but most users will have no problems with standard drives from the likes of Western Digital and Seagate. </p><p>Data loss is a bigger issue. A group of disks running as simple storage devices – a configuration known as JBOD (Just a Bunch Of Disks) – will experience a failure sooner or later. How you feel about the thought of hours spent re-importing your collection will govern your backup strategy. </p><p>A good option is to buy two identical disks and run either RAID 1 or RAID 5 configurations, if your NAS supports it. This builds tolerance into your system by duplicating data across both drives. </p><p><strong>Living room</strong></p><p><strong>The business end of the operation – enjoy your media collection in comfort</strong></p><p><img alt=\"Living room\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20303/TV%20network/PCP303.feat1.living_room-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>We\'ve reached the final stage – the point where you can almost sit back and enjoy the fruit of your labours. There\'s one problem left to solve, and that\'s getting your movies streamed to your TV. </p><p>The device we\'re going to use to bridge the divide between your NAS-bound media and your TV is a media streamer. These are low-powered boxes that specialise in decoding vast amounts of video data, encoded in dozens of different formats, and sending these to your screen. </p><p>Despite the encoding part requiring such a powerful PC, the decoding stage has been refined to such a degree that a small, embedded Realtek-chipset can do the job without difficulty. This is usually tied to a special version of Linux to handle access. Many even include space for an internal hard drive, but we\'ve been able to sidestep this requirement by using the NAS. </p><p>Remote drives also have the advantage of being quieter, and the NAS is a more flexible option if you need to stream video data to other locations in your house. </p><p><strong>Network compatibility <br /></strong></p><p>Your media streamer will need both an Ethernet port connected to a Powerline unit and an HDMI connector for plug-and-play compatibility with your television. There are other options available, but HDMI is perfectly suited to this task. It\'s digital, supports high resolutions, and pipes audio at the same time. </p><p>We\'re streaming video over the network rather than from local storage, so it\'s also important to ensure that your media streamer is compatible with your network configuration. Many devices fall at this hurdle by either failing to offer enough throughput for high definition playback, or making configuration too complicated. </p><p>Most devices play the vast majority of formats you\'re likely to come across, and are able to access the data on a NAS – either through the Windows networking protocol, or through UPnP, which is the option we recommend for pain-free setup. </p><p>The final piece of kit for our project is an inconspicuous PC for internet streaming and Freeview recording. Rather than using an off-the-shelf PVR, a low-powered PC will enable us to move our recording programming back to the NAS box for later viewing. It will also enable 100 per cent support for services including the BBC\'s iPlayer, ITV Player and Channel 4\'s 4oD. </p><p>This PC\'s low power means it should be almost silent, and suspend and resume should work with the minimum of effort. We recommend looking for an all-in-one unit based around an Atom processor, such as the £150, 1.6GHz dual-core CPU, Zotac Z-Box. It\'s a tiny, vertical case that needs only a 2.5in hard drive and some memory to become a fully-fledged PC for streaming. </p><p><strong>Record programmes </strong></p><p>Recording standard definition Freeview and Freesat broadcasts through a USB interface shouldn\'t cause any problems – most devices come with their own software for scheduling recordings, and even a remote control, which enables you to avoid the keyboard and mouse combination completely. </p><p>However, we recommend using Windows Media Centre, because it provides a more TV-friendly interface and includes its own DVR technology. </p><p><img alt=\"Windows media center\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/PC%20Plus/PCP%20303/TV%20network/PCP303.feat1.wmc_01-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Either way, you\'ll want to make sure the files that are saved by the recording process are placed on your network-mounted NAS box, which can then be used to stream recordings to any other networked player in your household. </p><p>Unfortunately, the ability to record and archive high-definition Freeview broadcasts is unresolved. The DVB-T2 hardware used to receive the signal is only just beginning to make its way into third-party PC devices, because it\'s currently used in just a couple of countries throughout the world. </p><p>Combine this with the DRM built into high-definition transmissions, and recording and moving high definition content may not be technically, or even legally feasible. Even if it was, you\'d need a fast local drive to store the data, before moving it onto a networked drive. </p><p>However, experiments with high definition satellite broadcasts show that the Atom specification of the system should be up to the job, provided the USB hardware is able to work around any restrictions and your graphics are accelerated. </p><p><strong>Enjoy your media </strong></p><p>All of this should leave you with an incredibly powerful system. You can now listen to your digital music collection, browse your photos and watch your high-definition movies without worrying about how to store the physical discs or where to find them. </p><p>The system is also omnipresent. You can access the same content from your netbook in the loft, your iPad in the bedroom and your TV in the living room, as well as allowing other people in the house to use streaming devices at the same time. </p><p>The only problem with such a system – and this comes from bitter experience – is that you\'re never quite finished. You\'ll always want to update something, tweak a setting or add a new piece of gadgetry to your network. </p><p>To appreciate your setup fully, you have to resist the temptation to continue tinkering. You have been warned.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/116d2cef/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a

Windows 7 HomeGroup','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image1-200-200.jpg\" /><p>HomeGroup is a feature exclusive to Windows 7. </p><p><p>It enables you to easily share music, photos, documents and even printers between different switched-on PCs on your home network without having to spend time configuring each system – you set up the HomeGroup using one PC, then join it using other machines on your network. </p><p>It\'s a really useful system and is so simple to get going – just follow my step-by-step guide below. </p><p>The great thing about HomeGroup is that you can share as much or as little as you want, and I\'ll also show you how to do that later in the tutorial. </p><p>You can only create a HomeGroup in the Home Premium, Professional or Ultimate Editions of Windows 7, but you can join one with any version. </p><p><strong>1. Find the HomeGroup settings </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>You can get to your HomeGroup settings various ways, including searching for HomeGroup in the Start menu, but I\'ve gone to Control Panel and under Network and Internet I\'ve selected Choose HomeGroup and sharing options. By the way, you can only be connected to one HomeGroup at any one time. </p><p><strong>2. Create your HomeGroup </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>As you can see from the screenshot above, there\'s currently no HomeGroup set up on our system. This window just gives you a little bit of blurb about what a HomeGroup is, so you can safely click through it by selecting Create HomeGroup at the bottom of the screen.</p><p> <strong>3. Choose which files </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The wizard now asks you which libraries you wish to share. You can be more precise about included files and folders at a later stage, but this is just a general set-up step. Sharing printers means you\'ll be able to print from one machine using the printer on another computer. </p><p><strong>4. Leave it out </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 4\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image4-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If in doubt, feel free to leave a library out – you\'ll be able to add it easily at a later stage. Here I\'ve decided that I actually don\'t want to share my music and videos, but that I do want to share my documents so that I can access them from other machines on the network. </p><p><strong>5. Start sharing </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 5\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image5-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Click Next and your HomeGroup is created – this may take a while depending on the speed of your PC. If you\'re worried about sharing your files, remember that only computers you allow (and that are running on your home network) can access your files. Click Next again when the process has finished. </p><p><strong>6. Your password </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 6\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image6-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>You now see this screen, with an automatically generated password. You need this password for other computers to join your HomeGroup. This is no substitute for password-protecting your wireless network – your router should be secure, too. Write down or print your password using the link. Click Finish. </p><p><strong>7. The nerve centre </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 7\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image7-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Now you\'re presented with this screen, which is the nerve centre of all your HomeGroup settings. As you can see, you can alter the libraries that you\'re sharing as well as view or print the HomeGroup password, should you have forgotten it. You can access the troubleshooter from here, too. </p><p><strong>8. Change settings </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 8\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image8-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>I\'ve changed my mind and decided that I want to share my music as well. Check the box next to the library in question, then click Save changes. My HomeGroup is now fully set up on my first machine and so next I\'ll explain how you can connect up another machine to the HomeGroup. </p><p><strong>9. Connecting another machine </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 9\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image9-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Now I\'m on a second PC – my laptop downstairs. It\'s connected to the same wireless network as my first PC. Once again, go to your HomeGroup settings in Control Panel. You can see that the machine has detected there is already a HomeGroup on the network, created by my first machine. Click Join now. </p><p><strong>10. Which libraries? </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 10\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image10-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>As with my first computer, my laptop is now asked which libraries I want it to share with other machines. This time I\'ve asked it to share all the media on this computer but none of the documents – I don\'t really store too many files on my laptop. Now click Next. </p><p><strong>11. Enter the password </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 11\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image11-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Now you\'re asked for the password that you saw on your first computer. Remember that if you\'ve forgotten it, you can return to your first computer to view it or to print it out. The password is case-sensitive, so you have to type it carefully. Once that\'s done, click Next. </p><p><strong>12. You\'re connected! </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 12\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image12-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>This screen means you\'re connected to the HomeGroup – it really is that simple to share your media and documents, and you\'ll be connected to the HomeGroup every time you start your Windows 7 PC. I\'ll just click Finish and I\'m done. Now repeat the process on any other Windows 7 PCs you want to connect up. </p><p><strong>13. Indexing libraries </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 13\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image13-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>This screen means Windows 7 is still indexing your libraries ahead of sharing them – I just leave it alone for a few minutes. If you connect to a different network using your HomeGroup machine, this same screen displays \"The HomeGroup is not available because you\'re not connected to the home network.\" </p><p><strong>14. Leaving a HomeGroup </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 14\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image14-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you really want to leave a HomeGroup, it\'s just as easy as joining one. In your HomeGroup settings (under Control Panel > Network and Internet), click Leave the HomeGroup. You then see this screen of options, which is basically checking that you do want to leave. Click Leave the HomeGroup again. </p><p><strong>15. Share or exclude files and folders </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 15\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image15-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>I want to exclude some folders from being shared. Navigate to the file or folder you want to exclude, and select it. In the toolbar, click Share with, then click Nobody. Should you want to include other folders, select them and choose either HomeGroup (Read) or HomeGroup (Read/Write) from this menu.</p><p> <strong>16. And that\'s it! </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 16\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Windows%20Vista/51/OWV51.anno_homegroup.image16-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>You now have a fully-functioning HomeGroup. If you encounter any problems, there\'s a HomeGroup troubleshooter to ease your pain, available on the main HomeGroup settings page within Control Panel > Network and Internet. Click Start the HomeGroup troubleshooter.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/11174110/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-viral\"><table

to build your own router','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/Linux%20Format/LXF%20139/LXF139.tut_routers.router2-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Linux is built on networking. It\'s at the core of the operating system, not a bolted on extension. This means that if you want to build an internet appliance, Linux is the obvious choice. </p><p><p>The most popular internet appliance is a router and most homes have one these days, translating your DSL or cable internet connection into Ethernet or wireless to be used by your computer. If you have more than one computer, such a device is even more important because it enables them to use the internet at the same time without getting their packets in a twist.</p><p> If you do have a number of computers, it\'s possible you have at least one that\'s neglected and gathering dust in a cupboard somewhere because it\'s no longer considered powerful enough for current needs. You\'ve probably thought about putting it on Ebay, but a combination of apathy and the rapidly diminishing value of older hardware means you never got round to it. </p><p>Well, you can give this box a new lease of life as an internet gateway. You may be asking why you would want to do this instead of using a pre-packaged modem/router. </p><p>One reason is that you can have far more control over exactly what goes on in the box, what functions it has and who can do what. Another reason for doing it is because it\'s a fun way of learning about such things, rather than just leaving it all to a magic black (or, more likely, white or silver) box. </p><p>There are two ways of approaching this task; the first is to use a distro specifically designed for the job, already set up with the packages you need. The other is to build it entirely yourself, using a minimal Linux installation and adding the software you need to do what you want. </p><p>This month, we\'ll look at the first path, but we\'ll cover the full DIY approach in the next issue. </p><p><strong>Pick a distro </strong></p><p>There are quite a few distros intended for use on firewall appliances, and some of them are based on FreeBSD rather than Linux. The distros can be divided into two groups, those that provide a dedicated firewall/router and those that comprise a more complete internet gateway, including things like print, mail, file and even web servers. </p><p>For this tutorial, we are concentrating on a pure gateway, a more flexible and powerful alternative to an off-the-shelf modem/router and one that enables the other services to be run more securely behind the firewall. </p><p>The distro that we\'ve picked for this example is <a href=\"http://www.ipcop.org/\">IPCop</a>. We are using the stable 1.4.21 release, although the more adventurous might consider the 1.9 version. </p><p>You will also need a computer, obviously. Just about anything modern enough to be powered by electricity should be acceptable. An i586 or later box can handle the internet requirements of a medium-sized network. </p><p>There\'s no desktop with IPCop – after installation, everything is done remotely via a web browser, so memory requirements on the hardware are minimal. You will need a keyboard and monitor for installation, but these can be removed once the system has rebooted. </p><p>The computer will need at least two network interfaces: Ethernet for the local network and whatever your internet connection needs. This could be a PCI DSL modem card, another Ethernet card to connect to a standard cable or DSL modem or even just a USB port if you have no wired connection and are using a 3G dongle. </p><p>If you want to set up a demilitarised zone (DMZ) you\'ll need another Ethernet card, and you\'ll need a wireless card if you want this box to also act as a Wi-Fi access point. An Ethernet switch or hub plugged into the green Ethernet port will enable multiple computers to be connected to the network. </p><p>Installation Boot from the IPCop CD to get into the text-based installer. If you have only used the graphical installers of the likes of OpenSUSE, Mandriva and Ubuntu, this may come as a bit of a shock – use the cursor keys to move around, the Space bar to select options and Enter to proceed. </p><p>Heed the warning early on: this installer will wipe your hard drive. You can\'t dual boot your router with Windows – this is a one-shot machine. </p><p>The lack of partitioning or package choices means there\'s very little for you to do prior to installation. Select Skip at the restore screen. The next step is to pick the Ethernet interface to use for the green network; the other interface(s) will be set up later. </p><p><img alt=\"step 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Linux%20Format/LXF%20139/LXF139.tut_routers.router1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Letting the installer probe for a suitable interface is generally best, although there are manual configuration options should your network adaptor need special module options passed to it. Because the router will also act as a DHCP server for your network, it must have its address assigned statically. If in doubt what to put here, 192.168.1.1 is a good choice. </p><p>You are now given the web address for configuration, so make a note of this. The network configuration type is one of the most important choices during installation; the historical default is to use Ethernet for green and a modem for the red network. If your modem connects via Ethernet, change this to GREEN + RED. </p><p>Choose the option that includes ORANGE or BLUE if you also want a DMZ or wireless sector in your network – you can change this later if you would rather keep it simple and just set up the red and green networks to start with. </p><p>You then need to tell IPCop what to use for the extra interfaces in the Drivers And Card Assignments section. </p><p><strong>Address configuration </strong></p><p>The DNS and Gateway section can be left blank if your modem gets this information from your ISP with DHCP, but the DHCP configuration section relates to the addresses that IPCop gives out over the green and blue networks. You specify a range of addresses from which IPCop can choose, but leave some for any computer that may use static addressing.</p><p> I generally start the DHCP range at 100 (192.168.1.100 if you used 192.168.1.1 for IPCop itself) and use lower addresses for any static allocations, for no other reason than it makes it immediately obvious whether an address has been given by DHCP. </p><p>You must also enable the DHCP server here. The primary DNS server can be left at the address of the IPCop computer, which means IPCop will act as a DNS cache, speeding up lookups when the same domain is referenced by more than one computer – how many computers on your network don\'t look up www.google.com or www.linuxformat.com? </p><p><img alt=\"step 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Linux%20Format/LXF%20139/LXF139.tut_routers.router3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Finally, you need to set passwords for three users. The root user is not normally used, unless you want to log in directly on the router, the admin user is the user of the web interface, which you will normally use for configuration, and the backup user. Now you can remove the installation CD and reboot. </p><p><strong>Starting up </strong></p><p>The computer will reboot to an unhelpful-looking login prompt, but you won\'t be using this. Open a browser on another computer on the green network and go to https://192.168.1.1:445, replacing the IP address with whatever you set in the installation. </p><p>If the computer you\'re connecting from had its network started after rebooting the router, you can use the hostname set in the installation instead; the default is ipcop (https://ipcop:445). Your browser will probably complain about an untrusted certificate when connecting, which you can tell it to accept. </p><p>This is because IPCop is using a self-generated certificate, so your browser can\'t check its trustworthiness. Since you\'ve just installed it, you know you can trust it. </p><p><img alt=\"Step 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Linux%20Format/LXF%20139/LXF139.tut_routers.router2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Remember the admin user\'s password you set up during installation? IPCop enables you to view the home page without it, but selecting anything pops up a password requester. </p><p>The first link you should select is System > Updates since the home page will have told you there are updates available. Press the Download button, which doesn\'t appear to do much, but the description of the updates should appear in the section below, so press Apply Now. </p><p>If you see an error that this is not an authorised update, your hardware clock is probably way out. This isn\'t uncommon on hardware that has not been used for years or had a BIOS reset. </p><p>Go to Services > Time server and set the time manually. Then tick the box to use a network time server and press Save. You have to set the time manually first because NTP will not change the time if the jump is too great. </p><p>The web interface is where you do everything from now on. If you want, you can now power down the router, disconnect the keyboard and monitor and tuck it away somewhere out of sight and sound before switching back on (but make sure it has enough air to cool itself). </p><p>Your new router should now be providing DHCP and DNS services to your local network and giving access to the internet, so it\'s time to start exploring the options. </p><p>Your first stop should be System > Backup, where you can create a DAT file containing all your settings, enabling you to roll back if your changes don\'t work out as intended. Do this before you start experimenting. You can even use the Export button to transfer this to a USB stick for safe keeping. </p><p><img alt=\"STep 4\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Linux%20Format/LXF%20139/LXF139.tut_routers.router4-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>Explore the features </strong></p><p>IPCop provides a number of services that are not enabled by default but are worth investigating and turning on. </p><p>These can be found in the Services menu and include a web proxy, to reduce traffic and response times for commonly used pages, a time server, a dynamic DNS feature to update your IP address on services like www.dyndns.org, intrusion detection with Snort and traffic shaping. The last is useful with several machines sharing limited bandwidth, you don\'t want someone\'s BitTorrent download of the latest Ubuntu ISO image to slow down your browsing of the Fedora forums. </p><p>By setting various port ranges to High for email ports such 25, 110 and 143, Medium for web ports 80 and 443, and Low for FTP (21) and BitTorrent (6881–6999) you can stop file downloads from slowing down browsing by too much while making sure that email always gets through. </p><p>We said that you can add a network post-installation, so how do you do this when there doesn\'t appear to be an option in the web interface? The answer is that this has to be done on the command line, either directly on your IPCop box (assuming it still has a keyboard and monitor) or via an SSH connection from the green network. For the latter, you need to enable SSH access from the System menu, then connect to it with: ssh -p 222 root@ipcop </p><p>Then run setup to get a curses GUI similar to the installer from where you can change choices made at that time. Go into Networking > Change Network Type and pick GREEN + ORANGE + RED to add a DMZ, or add a BLUE for a wireless sector. Either way, you must have a suitable network card already installed in the computer. </p><p><img alt=\"Step 5\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Linux%20Format/LXF%20139/LXF139.tut_routers.router5-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Go to Drivers And Card Assignments to pick the card for the new network, then use Address Settings to pick an address for the new network\'s interface. This must be on a different subnet, so if you used 192.168.1.1 for green, use 192.168.2.1 for orange. </p><p>Once you have done this, turn off SSH for security. </p><p><strong>Setting up the DMZ </strong></p><p>Now that you have a DMZ, you can begin setting it up. There is no DHCP server on the orange network, so any computer you add here should have a static address, which is a good thing if you\'re providing access from outside because you need to forward traffic to a specific address. </p><p>To set up access to a web server with the address of 192.168.2.2, the first step is to set up port forwarding, just as you would on a standard modem/router, except here we are forwarding to the server on the DMZ. </p><p>Go to Firewall > Port Forwarding page. The Source IP Or Network box is normally left blank, to enable access from all external addresses, but you can restrict access to a specific address or range if you wanted your server to only be accessible from one location (although a VPN may be a more suitable approach in this situation). </p><p>Set the source and destination ports to 80 (HTTP) and the Destination IP to 192.168.2.2, press Add to see the rule appear in the list below. Now hit Reset and repeat the process for port 443 (HTTPS). </p><p>Now you have a web server that is accessible from the internet and from your LAN (the green network), but it cannot access your green network. This means that if the server, or perhaps some PHP code it is running, is exploited, it can only harm itself, not the rest of your computers. </p><p><strong>Poking holes </strong></p><p>There may be times when your web server needs to communicate with a machine on the green network, for example sending a backup of its MySQL tables. </p><p><img alt=\"STep 6\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/Linux%20Format/LXF%20139/LXF139.tut_routers.router6-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>IPCop has a feature called a DMZ pinhole that provides restricted access from one computer in the orange network to one port on one computer in the green network. This is set up in Firewall > DMZ Pinholes but use this option only when you have to, because it partially compromises the security provided by the DMZ. </p><p>There is lots more you can do with IPCop, but we\'ve given you enough to get started. Browse around the web interface and read the associated documents on the IPCop website for more information.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

networking problems and fixes','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab3-200-200.jpg\" /><p>If you\'ve got problems with your Mac and your network, you\'ve come to the right place. </p><p>We\'ve gathered together the 20 most common OS X networking annoyances and solved them on the spot. <strong><br /></strong></p><p><strong>Q.</strong> When my MacBook is right next to the wireless router, it connects, but if I move to another room, it then asks for the password, even though other computers can connect just fine. </p><p><strong>A.</strong> This is a hardware fault with your MacBook\'s AirPort card or the antenna. The AirPort icon still reports a good signal because it is measuring the signal received from the router and the problem doesn\'t affect the receiver. But the transmitter\'s signal isn\'t strong enough to reach the router unless the range is virtually zero. It\'s time to get the AirPort card replaced – you can do so at an authorised Mac service centre. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I connect wirelessly to the internet with a BT Home Hub 2. Recently, Safari has started opening at btopenzone.com instead of my home page. What\'s going on?</p><p><img alt=\"BT fon homepage\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab6-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>A.</strong> If your ISP is BT, your router will create two networks – the password-protected one and an open one called BT FON that can be accessed by anyone with a BT broadband account If your router isn\'t available when your Mac starts for whatever reason, you can sometimes find yourself connected to a neighbour\'s FON network instead. Rightclick the AirPort icon and select the correct network to reconnect. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> My iMac used to be able to create computer-to-computer networks with my Windows laptop. Since upgrading to Snow Leopard, I can\'t do this. Why? </p><p><strong>A.</strong> If you use the Mac as a Wi-Fi base station, then Windows PCs at least, won\'t be able to connect to your network unless you untick the Require Password box. Alternatively, use a separate wireless router and connect both computers to that. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> How can I configure my AirPort Extreme to run both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands simultaneously, to give me two independent networks? </p><p><strong>A.</strong> It already uses both frequencies by default. The newer wireless n models automatically pick whichever band offers the best reception. Separate your network traffic at the IP address level, using a router – not by using different radio frequencies. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> When I\'m using MS Office, I frequently get asked whether I want the application to accept incoming network connections. Is there any particular reason why I might click \'allow\'? </p><p><strong>A.</strong> Incoming connections are network packets that were not specifically solicited by the application. MS Office applications listen on certain ports to receive notification of updates, for example.</p><p> If you have your firewall set to block all incoming connections, it won\'t be able to do this and that\'s why it pops up the message, asking if you want to let this one through. If you trust the application, it\'s safe; probably safer than leaving MS Office unpatched, in fact. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> How can I use my home Mac to access my Windows XP computer at work? </p><p><strong><img alt=\"GoToMyPC\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab8-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><br /></strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> You could use the Remote Desktop Host included with Windows XP Professional, but it\'s probably easier to use a web service like GoToMyPC.com, which enables you to access your Mac or PC from anywhere (for a price). </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I use an Orange Internet Livebox, with Wi-Fi turned off, connected using Ethernet to a Time Capsule in Bridge Mode. This provides my wireless network. However, I\'m restricted by the five-connection limit of the Livebox, even though I\'m using the Time Capsule. How can I get round this? </p><p><strong><img alt=\"NAT\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab12-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /><br /></strong></p><p><strong>A.</strong> In bridge mode, the AirPort Extreme and Time Capsule don\'t provide any network address translation. They just rebroadcast the network packets wirelessly, so you\'re still restricted to the five-address limit imposed by the Livebox. </p><p>Fortunately, however, the solution isn\'t a convoluted one. All you need to do is put the Time Capsule into NAT mode. This will take one of the five IP addresses handed out by the Livebox and split it into as many wireless addresses as you need. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> My hard drive is only 80GB and is almost full. I am thinking of getting a 1TB Time Capsule to fix this and also provide a wireless network. Is this the best solution? </p><p><strong>A.</strong> The Time Capsule won\'t back itself up, so whatever files you migrate to the 1TB disk will be unprotected. Also, your files will only be accessible over a Wi-Fi connection, which is much slower than USB or FireWire. Use an external disk directly connected to your Mac for your overflow storage. Then let the Time Capsule back up both this and the internal disk. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I have added a Time Capsule by connecting it directly to my broadband modem with an Ethernet cable. But my Mac now frequently selects the wrong network and AirPort Utility can\'t see the Time Capsule at all. </p><p><strong>A.</strong> Instead of connecting to the Wi-Fi network from the modem and reaching the Time Capsule through that, reconfigure the Time Capsule to create its own Wi-Fi network and turn off Wi-Fi on the modem. Having two wireless networks just increases interference. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I recently changed broadband provider. My networked printer, which used to work perfectly, now causes me to lose my network connection every time I turn it on. </p><p><strong>A.</strong> Your printer probably has a static IP address assigned which now conflicts with the IP address range used for DHCP on the new router. Change the printer to use DHCP as well, or move the static address to an unused number. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> After reinstalling OS X, my iBook won\'t accept the network password, even though all the other computers in the house connect perfectly well… </p><p><strong>A.</strong> Assuming that you\'re definitely using the right password for the router (and not confusing the router admin password with the AirPort password, say) the most likely problem is a corrupted plist and deleting this file should fix it. You\'ll find it in the folder Macintosh HD\\Library\\Preferences\\ System Preferences. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I sometimes get an error message that comes up and says \'IP Configuration\'. Nothing else seems wrong. Should I worry? </p><p><strong>A.</strong> This message occurs when another device tries to connect with the same IP address as you. You were there first, so the other device is locked out, but OS X is warning you about the conflict. Check all your network devices are using DHCP, or static IP addresses that don\'t overlap the DHCP range or conflict with each other. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I have an Apple TV that I would like to set up with my Buffalo LinkStation. Can I use this drive as my location for iTunes on my iMac and then play music and films on my Apple TV? </p><p><strong>A.</strong> Using NAS disks for iTunes is probably still more trouble than it\'s worth. iTunes has a habit of reverting to a local library if the NAS is in sleep mode when iTunes starts. You could enable the iTunes server on the LinkStation itself, but Apple TV won\'t connect directly to that. </p><p>Alternatively, connect the LinkStation directly to your Mac as an ordinary external disk. Your Mac would need to be on whenever you wanted to stream media to the Apple TV, though. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> What is the best way to add really old Macs (G4 and G3 iMacs) to my wireless network? </p><p><strong>A.</strong> Use a wireless bridge. It plugs into the Ethernet port on your Mac and lets the G4 ignore the wireless aspect. The bridge will relay all the traffic from the G4 to the router without the Mac ever being any the wiser. The Airport Express will do this, but Belkin and Linksys also have compatible bridges. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I have moved my iTunes and iPhoto libraries to a networked hard drive. Unfortunately, I can no longer use Front Row to watch or listen to my media. Is there anything I can do to point Front Row at an external drive? </p><p><strong>A.</strong> Front Row won\'t access networked drives directly, but you can easily create an alias to one and drop that into your Movies or Music folder. Provided that the network drive is accessible and mounted, Front Row should display this perfectly well, though there might be a short delay for Front Row to buffer the stream before it begins playing. </p><p><strong>Q.</strong> I\'m trying to connect a PC and a Mac. In System Preferences, under Sharing-Services, I\'ve ticked Personal Web Sharing and under Sharing-Internet I\'ve turned on Internet Sharing. But if my Mac has access to the internet, the PC can\'t get onto the web at the same time. </p><p><img alt=\"Personal web sharing\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab13-420-100.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p><strong>A.</strong> Personal web sharing is just so that you can have web pages on your local hard disk that others on your network can view as if they were published on the internet; it has nothing to do with sharing an internet connection. And the Internet Sharing preferences setting is designed to allow your Mac to share its own internet connection with one or more computers on that network. </p><p>This is what your router is already doing, and by enabling it on the Mac as well you are just tangling everything up. Turn off Internet Sharing on the Mac (and the PC too if it is enabled there) and just let the router handle the NAT.</p><p> <strong>Q.</strong> What is MAC access control and will enabling it improve my Wi-Fi security at all?</p><p> <strong>A.</strong> The Media Access Control, or MAC, address is hard-coded into every network device at manufacture and is unique to each one. You\'ll find it by selecting About This Mac from the Apple menu and then clicking the More Info… button. </p><p>Then select Network from the list on the left and scroll the right-hand pane all the way down to the bottom, where you should see the MAC address in question presented as six, two-digit, hexadecimal numbers.</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\"

One of five Linksys Wireless-N E2000 routers','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/networking-and-wi-fi/images/linksys-e2000-200-200.jpg\" /><p>We\'ve teamed up with Linksys to offer you the chance to win one of five Linksys Wireless-N E2000 routers.</p><p>The Linksys E2000 offers selectable dual-band wireless-N technology and extended range to provide wireless coverage throughout your home. </p><p>This router is ideal for sharing your home\'s Internet connection with your family\'s other computers and devices such as games consoles and smartphones. You can easily customise your security settings, set Parental Controls, and access advanced settings. </p><p>All Linksys E-Series routers have advanced WPA/WPA2 wireless security and SPI firewall protection, which are designed to safeguard your home network and computers from most Internet attacks and help protect your data and privacy.</p><p>The Linksys E2000 incorporates internal antenna technology that provides extended range so it\'s ideal for larger homes. The four Gigabit Ethernet ports let you connect networked storage and other Gigabit Ethernet-enabled devices to quickly transfer files at up to 1,000Mbps. </p><p><strong>Dual-band coverage</strong></p><p>You\'re also able to choose from two radio bands - 2.4GHz or 5GHz radio bands. The standard 2.4GHz band is increasingly crowded and so 5GHz offers great performance for video streaming and smoother file transfers.</p><p><strong>This competition is now closed. The winners are Lynda Groves, Dennis Tebbs, Alex Shelley, Elliot Lewis and Ian Yates.</strong></p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p><p><strong>Please note that this competition is only open to UK residents over 18 years of age.</strong></p><p><strong>There is no cash alternative to the prize and unless agreed otherwise in writing the prize is non-refundable and non transferable.</strong></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/108c91e5/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/b22299c/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Cwi0Efi0Chow0Eto0Ecatch0Ehackers0Eon0Eyour0Ewireless0Enetwork0E69550A0A0Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Guide: How to catch hackers on your wireless network</a></li><li><a href=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/b25fc5f/l/0L0Stechradar0N0Cnews0Cnetworking0Cwi0Efi0Cwin0Elinksys0Edual0Eband0E80A20E11n0Egigabit0Erouters0E6961230Dsrc0Frss0Gattr0Fnewsnetwor/story01.htm\">Closed: WIN!

They\'re a lot better than they used to be, but they\'re still the most complicated part of your Mac. </p><p>When you send a document to a networked printer, it\'s handed down from one protocol to another, broken into chunks, each with their own addressing scheme, until eventually it\'s transmitted as radio signals to represent those bits and bytes. As your print job flies through the air, it encounters interference and cross-talk from mobile phones, microwaves and power tools. </p><p>Your Wi-Fi access point plucks this signal from the air and reassembles the scrambled mess. Small errors are corrected, large errors are replaced with valid data, patiently re-sent. Your router reads the address on each packet and chooses the best way to pass it to its destination. </p><p>At the printer, the packets of data are placed in the correct order, the envelopes are opened and the wrappers discarded. As your document is finally translated from electricity to ink, the printer sends you a confirmation message that this miraculous endeavour has succeeded. And to get to you, that message makes the same incredible journey back through the protocol layers and across the airwaves to reach your Mac. At least, that\'s what you hope happens. </p><p>With so many different steps, it\'s no wonder that things sometimes go wrong. Network problems can feel daunting, with intermittent faults and error messages. But we\'re going to put a stop to all that. With our guide, we\'ll show you how your network is put together and where the choke points are. We\'ll cover how to set up a new network and why some networks are more error-prone than others. We\'ll tell you what kit to buy and what to avoid. </p><p>Despite all this, your network may still sometimes break. Long after death and taxes have both been abolished, network problems will remain. Home networking is a rough neighbourhood and you\'re always going to get shot at. But armed with the next few pages, you\'ll be able to roll for cover and return fire. </p><p><strong>Networking basics </strong></p><p>When you get broadband, your internet service provider (ISP) normally supplies you with a broadband modem. This, plus your Mac, is the simplest network you can have, and for lots of people it\'s all the network they need.</p><p> If you have ADSL broadband – the most common kind – it\'s delivered to your house through the phone line. At the phone socket, you plug in a filter that splits the frequency range, so that the lower 4KHz is used by voice phone calls and the rest is sent to the modem. The modem takes the analogue electrical signal from the phone line and extracts the digital data stream encoded within it. </p><p>This data takes the form of network \'packets\' that are wrapped up using an addressing protocol called TCP/IP. (This is a fairly meaningless acronym, so don\'t bother trying to remember what it stands for.) Each TCP/IP packet contains a small piece of a website, or a graphic, or a downloaded file, or whatever is being sent from the internet. And every packet has a number, called an IP address, which identifies which computer or device it\'s intended for. </p><p>Your broadband modem has an IP address assigned to it by your ISP and, if you have a modem that plugs into a USB port on your Mac, then this IP address is available exclusively for the use of that Mac. </p><p>But if you want to connect more than one computer through the same broadband connection, you need a router – if you\'re not sure where yours is, that\'s because most modern broadband modems have a router built-in. If your modem has sockets for Ethernet cables, then it is actually a modem/router. </p><p><strong>Router vs modem </strong></p><p>The router is like a telephone exchange; it assigns separate IP addresses to all the computers connected to it and acts as a single point of contact for the wider network beyond it. When an incoming TCP/IP packet arrives from the internet, the router opens it and re-addresses it using the local IP addresses of your home network. This process is called Network Address Translation, or NAT. </p><p>As well as enabling your broadband connection to be shared among many computers, NAT provides a measure of security from hackers, as the IP address of your Mac is never exposed to the wider internet. Only the router uses the external IP address provided by your ISP. </p><p><img alt=\"BT router\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab1-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>This anti-hacking function is called a firewall. By itself, NAT already does quite a good job, but almost all routers nowadays have much more sophisticated hardware firewalls that actively block probing attacks and make it hard for a hacker to tell that you\'re actually connected to the internet at all. </p><p><strong>Going wireless </strong></p><p>A broadband/router with a Mac connected via an Ethernet cable is the simplest configuration. But your phone socket doesn\'t generally come into the house right next to the Mac and most of us would rather not have to start tacking Ethernet cable around the skirting board. The solution is wireless networking, also called Wi-Fi or AirPort. </p><p>A Wi-Fi connection is provided using a wireless access point and, again, most broadband modems include this in the same device. Instead of converting the TCP/IP packet into an electrical signal to transmit it along an Ethernet cable, a wireless access point broadcasts it as a radio signal. This is received by the Wi-Fi antenna in your Mac. </p><p>There are several international standards for Wi-Fi devices. They are cryptically labelled as 802.11a, 802.11b and so on, but they are usually just referred to by the last letter – as \'wireless b\', for example. The most widely used systems are b, g and n. The later letters are faster, or more reliable, or both, but they are backwards-compatible with earlier Wi-Fi standards. </p><p>Generally, the slowest point in your network is your broadband connection, so unless you do a lot of transfers between devices on your network (to and from a networked disk, for example) it\'s a non-issue. </p><p>If you want to print across your network, you can always connect the printer to one of your computers and share it from there. But this only works when that computer is running. Some printers are network-aware and can be connected to your router directly. Otherwise, you can use a print server. </p><p><strong>Your printer is served </strong></p><p>This device connects to your router with a wired or wireless connection and lets you plug in one or more printers. It keeps its own queue of print jobs and makes sure they go to the right printer. </p><p>Apple\'s own-brand network devices are the AirPort Extreme Base Station, the Airport Express and the Time Capsule. An AirPort Extreme is a router with a wireless access point built-in. This is the same as the Wi-Fi router/modem from your ISP, except that it doesn\'t have the modem part. </p><p>There are still some reasons why you might want to add an AirPort Extreme though. It has a USB port that you can use to add an external hard disk or a printer (or both if you use a USB hub); these will then be accessible across the network, from your Mac. </p><p>The AirPort Express is a cut-down version of the Extreme. It only supports 10 simultaneous wireless devices instead of 50, and only one wired connection instead of three. The USB port on the Express can only be used to network a printer, not a hard disk, but it does include a stereo speaker jack that you can use to connect speakers or an amplifier and stream your music wirelessly from your iTunes library on your Mac. </p><p>Time Capsule is an AirPort Extreme with a hard disk actually built-in. You can use the disk for overflow storage or you can allocate it for use with Time Machine backups. You can also do this with a USB drive plugged into an Airport Extreme, but it\'s a setup that isn\'t officially supported by Apple, and using a Time Capsule is a little tidier. </p><p>When a network problem strikes, it isn\'t always immediately obvious. It\'s rare to get a clear message on the screen and it\'s easy to imagine that your Facebook app has simply crashed or a website is temporarily offline. </p><p>A good first check is to open a new window in Safari and try pointing at www.google.com. The web requires the least complicated protocols of any of the services that run over the internet, and Google has a nice fast web page that is always up. </p><p><img alt=\"internet fail\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab2-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>The front page itself could be loading from Safari\'s internal cache, of course, so test your live connection to the internet by typing something random into the search box to force it to query the server. If you get a page of results, then you have an internet connection, at least. </p><p>If you get a progress bar that goes nowhere, followed by a \'Safari can\'t find the server\' page, you\'ve got problems. </p><p>If you have a wireless connection to your broadband router, cast a glance up at the menu bar on your Mac. The \'stripy slice of pie\' icon on the right-hand side should be black. If it\'s greyed out, right-click it and see if you\'re connected to the right network. </p><p>Sometimes you\'ll see your Wi-Fi network listed in the \'available\' section, but it won\'t have a tick against it to show that it\'s selected. This is because the network briefly disappeared from the radar and OS X hasn\'t automatically reconnected when it came back up. Just click it on the list to reconnect. </p><p><img alt=\"network list\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab3-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If your Wi-Fi link looks okay but you still have no internet connection, it\'s time to take a look at the router. Broadband modem/routers are little computers running an embedded operating system and they can crash just like any other computer. </p><p>If none of the lights on the front are flickering – either because they are all stuck on or they are all switched off – turn the modem off at the wall. Actually, do this even if your modem lights look normal – different modems use different light sequences to indicate problems and rebooting the modem is an easy and quick way to rule out a crash. </p><p><strong>Light show </strong></p><p>When your modem starts up it will begin with a power-on self-test, which is normally indicated by the power light flashing steadily. After about five seconds of this, the power light will change to steady. Next to light up will be the LAN lights for any wired Ethernet connections that are active, closely followed by the WLAN light, which should start blinking away. </p><p><img alt=\"router\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab4-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>After that there will be a pause as your modem logs in to your ISP and then the light labelled \'broadband\', \'ADSL\' or just \'DSL\' will come on. After that, there should be another pause before the internet light comes on to indicate that the router has been allocated an external IP address from the ISP. If all the lights come on in more or less this sequence, then you can be confident that the broadband modem is working fine. </p><p>If any of the lights are yellow or red, or if the broadband or internet lights don\'t come on at all, then it could be that your modem is damaged. This can happen if the modem isn\'t ventilated and has overheated, or if the phone lines near your house are struck by lightning, sending a power surge to the modem. (This is why it\'s a good idea to disconnect the phone line from the modem if you have a big thunderstorm nearby.) </p><p>Alternatively, your ISP may be having technical problems at your exchange. Try calling their support hotline to check this.</p><p> <strong>Simplify, simplify </strong></p><p>Assuming that the modem restarts correctly but your network problems remain, the next step is to take as much complexity out of your network as you can. This will help you identify which link in the chain is failing. </p><p>Does your iPod touch or iPad still connect through Wi-Fi? If so, it\'s a sign that the problem lies with your Mac. If none of them can connect, try a wired connection. There are lots of things that can cause Wi-Fi networks to suddenly break, but most of them boil down to either incompatibility with another network device or problems with wireless security. </p><p>If you have recently changed broadband provider your wireless security key will have changed, but the new modem/router might also be using a different wireless security protocol. Some older network devices and computers have problems with the newer WPA2 protocol. Try temporarily turning security off and see if that makes a difference. </p><p>It\'s possible you might need to fall back to the older WEP protocol. This is less secure than WPA or WPA2, but it\'s still better than nothing. Wireless security is only to protect yourself from hackers within physical wireless range of your network, so depending on your neighbours you might not really need more than WEP. </p><p>Every device on your network must have a unique IP address. These take the form 192.168.1.n, where n is a number between 0 and 255. When you install a device, you can either choose a number for it yourself or you can let the router allocate one automatically, using a service called DHCP. </p><p><img alt=\"DHCP\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20228/MAC228.main_feat.grab5a-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Using DHCP for all devices is usually the easiest option, but some devices don\'t support it or behave oddly with it. If you assign static IP addresses to some of your network devices, make sure that you restrict the address range that the DHCP server on your router can use, and assign static IP addresses that do not lie in this range. </p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/10873c07/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related Stories</p><ul><li><a

out, with customers in Hackmondike, Farnborough, Colchester and Barry in South Wales all now able to subscribe to the superfast connection. </p><p>Virgin Media is keen to keep its edge as BT begins to

100mbps service in October</a>. </p><p><strong>Router</strong></p><p>The service, which also provides 10Mbps upload speeds, also comes with a new wireless router. </p><p>As a flagship product, the

1Gbps broadband in 2011','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//classifications/computing/internet-and-broadband/images/bt-hq-200-200.jpg\" /><p>BT has announced that it will trial 1Gbps broadband in Kesgrave, Suffolk – as well as rolling superfast broadband to 40 \'rural market towns\'. </p><p>Although it has lagged behind Virgin Media in its fibre optic offering, BT is pumping money into its Infinity offering and will now look to trial broadband speeds that have previously been available only in countries like Korea. </p><p>The trial will take place in Suffolk commencing in 2011, but don\'t expect to have 1Gbps broadband to your home for a considerable time, with BT still desperately trying to enhance the coverage of its fledgling fibre infrastructure. </p><p><strong>40 towns</strong></p><p>The promise of rolling superfast speeds to 40 rural towns is also a major positive, although details will not be announced until the next year. </p><p>\"BT will…be including up to 40 rural market towns in the next phase of exchanges for fibre broadband, said BT.</p><p>\"These areas will be able to enjoy the benefits of the technology from late 2011/early 2012. BT plans to announce the next list of exchanges in January 2011.\"</p><p><strong>Push the limits</strong></p><p>Olivia Garfield, BT\'s director of strategy, said: \"We intend to continually push the limits of our super-fast broadband programme in terms of the technology and the geography. </p><p>\"While everyday consumers don\'t require Gigabit speeds today, it\'s important that we test the maximum speed capabilities of our fibre broadband product to ensure that it is fully future proofed. </p><p>\"Furthermore, by evolving our deployment model for fibre we have been able to push the geographical boundaries of super-fast broadband. </p><p>\"It allows us to build a commercial case for rolling out fibre to selected towns in rural areas to satisfy the growing appetite for faster broadband speeds. </p><p>\"Both of these developments will further advance BT\'s super-fast broadband vision and will assist the Government in achieving its aim of creating the best super-fast broadband network in Europe.\"</p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/10404d1b/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div class=\"mf-related\"><p>Related

to share files over a network in OS X','<img src=\"http://cdn.mos.techradar.com//Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.intro-200-200.jpg\" /><p>Sharing files between computers used to be something of a dark art, and this has perhaps permeated the collective consciousness of Mac users. </p><p><p>Seemingly few realise how simple it is to enable file sharing across networked Macs.</p><p> In fact, with each revision of Mac OS X, Apple has made it easier to share files over a network, and to access networked Macs if you have relevant clearance. </p><p>This walkthrough takes you through the process of sharing files with other Mac users, and also details settings that will enable Windows users to access your Mac (although those settings should only be active for as long as they need to be). </p><p>We also briefly mention how to share your photos and music using iPhoto and iTunes, rather than attempting to do the same using standard file sharing. When it comes to file sharing, it\'s worth noting that you should only share what you\'re comfortable for anyone on the network to access. </p><p>The Sharing System Preferences pane, iTunes and iPhoto all avoid defaulting to sharing all of your content, instead letting you decide what you want to share. However, do note that guest accounts cannot do anything destructive with your files. </p><p>For example, if someone uses a guest account to access a shared folder via Finder, they can view the folder and open files, but they cannot delete anything, nor can they edit files \'live\'. Only when you provide someone with login details (a username and password) can they edit documents on the shared computer – so only give out those details when you\'re absolutely certain they won\'t be misused. </p><p>Finally, shared files can only be accessed when the host Mac is awake, so be mindful of network users when shutting your Mac down. </p><p>How to share files over a network in OS X:</p><p><strong>01. Unlock sharing settings</strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 1\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.001-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>In System Preferences, click the Sharing icon under Internet & Wireless. In the Sharing pane, click the lock icon. In the subsequent dialog box, type your admin password (and username, if relevant) and then click OK to continue and return to the pane. </p><p><strong>02. Enable file sharing </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 2\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.002-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Check File Sharing and you\'ll see the LED graphic next to File Sharing go green. Under Shared Folders, you can determine which folders are shared by default. Click + to add to the \'Public\' folder(s). To removed a folder, select it and click the minus (–) button. </p><p><strong>03. Access the files </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 3\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.003-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>Other Macs on the network should show your shared machine\'s name (the one stated in the Computer Name field in the Sharing pane) in the Shared section of Finder sidebars. Select a machine to connect to it as a guest and browse the folders enabled in the previous step.</p><p> <strong>04. Connect as a user</strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 4\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.004-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you own multiple Macs and need fuller access to one that\'s been set to share files, click Connect As… underneath the Finder window\'s search field. Type in your username and password for access to the same content you can usually access on the shared machine. </p><p><strong>05. Share with Windows</strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 5\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.005-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you need to share folders with Windows users, return to the Sharing pane and click Options. In the sheet, check Share files and folders using SMB. They should then be accessible via the Windows sidebar (My Network places in XP; Network in Windows 7). </p><p><strong>06. Share photos </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 6\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.006-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you want to share photos, avoid file sharing and use iPhoto. Open the Sharing section of iPhoto\'s preferences and check Share my photos; either check Share entire library or select albums to share. Other users can access shared content via the sidebar\'s Shares section. </p><p><strong>07. Share music</strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 7\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.007-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>If you want to share your music, you could share /Music in step 2, but it\'s simpler to use iTunes. Again, use the Sharing section within preferences, and share your library or selected playlists. Connected users will be able to navigate shared content in List view only. </p><p><strong>08. Use Home Sharing </strong></p><p><img alt=\"step 8\" src=\"http://mos.futurenet.com/techradar/Review%20images/MacFormat/MAC%20227/MAC227.tut_bins.008-420-90.jpg\" width=\"420\" /></p><p>iTunes offers a second way to share content across computers. Advanced > Turn On Home Sharing activates Home Sharing, which enables purchased content to be automatically transferred to authorised computers. But for occasional sharing, stick to the previous step.</p></p><img border=\"0\" height=\"1\" src=\"http://rss.feedsportal.com/c/669/f/415082/s/fd29543/mf.gif\" width=\"1\" /><div
