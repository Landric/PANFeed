<h3 id="what-is-a-feed">What is a Feed?</h3>
<p>A web feed (or "syndicated" feed) is a method of publishing frequently updated content on the internet. Content providers publish a feeds and users subscribe to those they want to view. PANFeed allows you to search for feeds relating to your interests, or publish items that you want to share with the world.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="how-do-i-view-feeds">How do I view feeds?</h3>
<p>You can view feeds in a feed agregator or "reader" such as <a href="http://www.google.com/reader">Google Reader</a>, <a href="http://reader.feedshow.com/">Feed Show</a> or <a href="http://www.newsalloy.com/">News Alloy</a>. These allow you to add different feeds and view their content - they will also notify you when the feed is updated.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="what-is-a-feed">What is a Special Issue?</h3>
<p>An Issue is a collection of articles (not necessarily feeds, but ordinary web pages) chosen by a user. PANFeed allows you to order these articles however you choose, add editorial items to give them context and then publish them to share them with the world. Think of it as a special edition of a magazine: once you've finished reading it, it can be stored to read again later.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="where-are-these-feeds-from">Where are these Feeds from?</h3>
<p>A program called a "crawler" is used to find all RSS and Atom feeds under an academic domain (with the owner's permission), which are then catalogued and analysed for keywords.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="how-to-crawl">How do I get my institution's feeds included in PANFeed?</h3>
<p>If you represent an academic institution, such as a university, you can <a href="/crawlme/">get your institution's feeds added here</a>.</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="i-want-to-host-panfeed">I'd like to host PANFeed at my institution</h3>
<p>If you want to host PANFeed at your own institution, that's great! The sourcecode is available on <a href="https://github.com/Landric/PANFeed">Git Hub</a> and legacy code is available at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/panfeed/">Google Code</a>. Full installation instructions will be posted soon!</p>
<br/>
<h3 id="bugs">Help! Something doesn't work!</h3>
<p>Don't worry! PANFeed is in continuous development, and functionality may change or break without warning. If you notice something that doesn't seem to be working quite right, please email us at: <a href="mailto:panfeed@gmail.com">panfeed@gmail.com</a></p>
