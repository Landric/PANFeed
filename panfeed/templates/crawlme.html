<h2>How can my university be added?</h2>
    <p>At the moment we are monitoring the interest in PANFeed quite closely, in a friendly and personal way. If you would like us to add your university to the PANFeed service the please drop us an email at <a href="mailto:pm5@ecs.soton.ac.uk">pm5@ecs.soton.ac.uk</a>. In general we are trying to keep the news sources academic, as a result we would prefer to only harvest urls with a .ac.uk or .edu domain. We are reasonable people so if you have a good academic source at a different domain please still email us and well take a look.</p>

<h2>Add my feed!</h2>
<p>PANFeed is now able to take submissions of single feeds automatically. If you have a blog or repository or other RSS or Atom feed then we want to here from you. Your feed will be added to the queue of feeds we read and within the hour your feed will be crawlled, indexed and start appearing in the appropriate custom feeds. We only accept feeds from .ac.uk or .edu domains but if you have another source email us on the address above. </p> 

<p>To submit you feed simply copy its url into the box below. Remember your feed must be web accessible for us to index it. Happy feeding!</p>
